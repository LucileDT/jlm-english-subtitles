00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.320
Alexis Corbière: Hello! Hello Paris!

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.960
Céleste Van Isterdael: And hello Aubervillers! Hello Saint-Denis!

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.860
Alexis Corbière: La France Insoumise is so beautiful!

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.800
They're so many of you!

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.640
So many of you!

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.980
Since the beginning, our strength has been our number!

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.600
We are this great popular force!

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:08.040
This happy, powerful, conscious force,
and we'll keep being like this until the end!

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.260
Dear friends, we all gathered here today to live an exceptional event,

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.140
an unbelievable France Insoumise rally,
a world premiere!

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.360
This morning, all of you must have been as curious as I was.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.820
You must have thought that after all,
the world entered the 21st century,

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.120
and the time has come for holograms! (reference to a musical)

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.440
Céleste Van Isterdael: This campaign and this movement are primarily made up of people who commit themselves,

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.580
you Insoumis and Insoumises.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.840
This afternoon, we'll be working twice harder because we have a double Jean-Luc,

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.800
and because the two of us will present this rally.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.880
You probably already saw him and heard him on TV, on the radio,

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.140
he is one of the spokespersons of Jean-Luc,

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:21.600
and he might be laid off if Jean-Luc keeps organizing holographic rallies.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:22.920
It's a possibility.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.340
He'll be presenting this rally with me today, his name is Alexis Corbière.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:37.520
AC: She is not a well-paid parliamentary assistant who has difficulties proving she actually works (reference to the Fillon affair).

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.920
She is not a writer for a magazine who never met the chief editor.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.820
She is a teacher—a useful job!

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:54.060
Her name is wonderful, and it perfectly suits the performance that we are about to live.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.800
Her name is Céleste Van Isterdael,
and I'll say 'tu' Céleste.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.220
CVI: Stop...

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.900
Stop joking, they'll think we are Céleste and Babeard.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.000
Jean-Luc is getting prepared at a distance of exactly
454 km,

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.940
and yet in about 20 minutes,
he'll be both here and there.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.580
It is a world premiere.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.920
Jean-Luc will be live with us thanks to an hologram.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:32.660
We've been campaigning for a year now,
and all France is waking up and turning Insoumise (rebel/unsubdued).

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.460
You are here today,

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.160
and we're creating a real dynamic with a France Insoumise that refuses the presidential monarchy

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.660
and that advocates the establishment of a 6th Republic.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.340
We are...

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.940
We are 77 days from the first round of the presidential election,

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.840
and when we see the heavy turnout here and in Lyon

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.560
—some people are standing in line on a distance of several hundred meters here and in Lyon—

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:12.000
we perfectly know that the only reliable poll is you, your enthusiasm, your number and your mobilization.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.200
AC: Yes!

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.140
We are currently 230,000 Insoumis,

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.400
2,400 support groups across the country,

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.720
we are the leading political movement in France,
I think we can say this, Céleste.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:36.480
CVI: These support groups and these political activists make La France Insoumise.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.820
La France Insoumise is not a party but a movement,
and it has a programme, "L'Avenir en commun" (Common Future).

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.040
AC: Indeed, it's not a party but a movement that was launched almost a year ago.

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.100
Remember, our anniversary will be next February 10th,

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.420
Jean-Luc Mélenchon announced he was running for president on February 10th 2016,

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:03.840
and immediately thousands of contributions poured in on the website jlm2017.fr.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.240
These thousands of contributions helped us write the program "L'Avenir en commun".

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.260
All this energy enabled us to make this movement live.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.500
We can only rely on ourselves,
bankers are not our friends,

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:23.300
which is why we need everyone who can to donate until the month of April.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:29.480
CVI: Among other things, your financial contributions enable us to fund Jean-Luc's famous Youtube channel.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:36.220
Each week, he reviews major events, and we are now 197,000 subscribers to his Youtube channel,

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.860
and we are close to reach the number of 200,000 subscribers!

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.880
We are 950,000 followers on Twitter, 633,000 on Facebook,

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.040
and we are now going to watch the highlights of his Weekly Review on the screens.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:57.340
Hello my friends, this is the first episode of a series of videos.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.320
[The Weekly Review]

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.120
Hello, it's me again!

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.220
Hello people!

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:07.300
Hello people!

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.980
Hello!

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:09.880
So now I'm going to talk to you about Trump.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.000
You heard that there was a referendum in Italy.

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.540
The pardon case of Jacqueline Sauvage.

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.840
An increase of poverty in the country.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.840
Trump's election in the USA.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.780
Video games are entering the 3D dimension.

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.500
CETA is the treaty with the USA.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.020
Oceans! My dealing with oceans is not a surprise.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:33.740
I'm doing this with Lise who is filming right now, while Mathias is just watching doing nothing.

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:42.860
It's one of the four most offered books for Christmas,
and I'd like to know why it was not THE most offered book!

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:45.060
I know why: you chickened out!

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:47.000
Can't stenchon the Melenchon!

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.920
What do you rely on?
The Socialist Party's primary election? Is that it?

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.980
Their thing is not a primary, it's depressing!

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.080
Yes, we canchon!

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.420
Water with good vibes! Hmm, perfect!

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.500
It's the only mug that purifies water.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:07.320
As a result, I got a present from Youtube.
Let me show you.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.000
It's Youtube Play Button for channels that reached 100,000 subscribers.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.040
You just saw Jean-Luc on the screens,

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:24.780
but you'll see him as large as life on March 18th for the restorming of the Bastille.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:29.760
He'll be with us, with you, and with tens of thousand of activists from all over France.

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:35.900
We want to thank each and everyone of you activists from Lyon, from Ile-de-France (district around Paris),

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.220
without whom this rally would not have been possible.

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:42.980
You are pushing back the frontiers of activism more and more everyday,

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:46.860
from Lebanon to Chile, from Japan to Aubervilliers,

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.620
and our rally will deal with the frontiers of humanity.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:51.800
AC: Yes.

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:58.780
Frontiers have always been an intellectual matter.

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:04.680
The frontiers we are going to deal with today do not enclose us, it's precisely the opposite.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:09.880
The frontiers of humanity are today's limits of the world we know,

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:17.180
for there is an unknown world that is waiting to be discovered thanks to the forces of the human mind.

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:24.560
These three great frontiers that we want to push back are the sea, space and the virtual and digital world.

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:30.340
CVI: And we're going to begin with the sea, because you know that our country is one of the leading maritime powers.

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:34.420
AC: You know that oceans covers 70 % of the Earth's surface.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.140
This is why we call it the Blue Planet,
and maybe we should have called it the Sea Planet.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.980
It is a source of tremendous possibilities.

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:49.900
CVI: Oceans are the first pillar of these new fontiers.
It amazes us like the stars that guide sailors.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.160
Stars that...

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:57.220
Ac: I think that someone from Lyon is going to contact us in a few seconds.

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.680
Both: We are about to witness a world premiere.

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:10.080
AC: Apparently, there's a lot of people in Lyon too.

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:19.780
We just need...

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:25.520
We just need to wait a few seconds.

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:33.380
We'll say it again, but as you saw, there's a huge turnout.
A lot of people are still waiting outside here and in Lyon,

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:40.260
and in a few seconds, we'll be in contact with Charlotte Girard and Guillaume Taddu

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.160
who are presenting the Lyon rally.

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:47.480
We just need to wait a few seconds...

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:51.460
Someone is talking in my ear, you know?

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:58.500
As you understood, the three great frontiers of humanity are the sea, the Earth, and the virtual and digital world.

00:09:58.500 --> 00:09:59.400
CVI: And space!

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.300
AC: And space!

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.160
CVI: Stars!

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:05.280
AC: So...?

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:10.800
AC: Let's carry on then!

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:16.460
CVI: So oceans are the first pillar!

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:17.380
AC: Exactly!

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.280
CVI: The first pillar...

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:37.180
that amazes us like stars, and stars are a point of reference for sailors but they're also new frontiers

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.300
that we need to push back.

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:44.300
AC: As you see, we're trying to push back these new frontiers of humanity.

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.640
And there we are!

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:48.480
Guillaume Taddu: Thank you! Louder please! We're joining Alexis Corbière and Céleste live from Paris

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:53.420
Alexis Corbière is Jean-Luc Mélenchon's spokesman, and Céleste is an activist of La France Insoumise

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:55.900
Hello to you both, how is it going in Paris?

00:12:55.980 --> 00:13:02.060
CVI: It's going great here! There's 6,000 of us and both rooms are full!

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:05.780
Some people are standing in line outside.

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:12.040
The atmosphere is great, and I suggest that we applaud until Lyon hears us.

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:13.220
Let us hear you!

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:47.340
Everyone: Resistance! Resistance! Resistance!

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:56.180
Charlotte Girard: Well, I think that people from Lyon are here too!

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:07.240
GT: The atmosphere is great between Lyon and Paris,
and I have a figure to communicate.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:16.940
As you heard, there are 6,000 people in Paris, and there's 12,000 of us here in Lyon!

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:28.220
This makes a total of 18,000 people in Lyon and Paris for this rally today!

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:33.900
There's 18,000 of us for this great rally of February 5th!

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:45.340
So Alexis and Céleste, can you quickly describe the place to us?

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:49.220
Jean-Luc Mélenchon's hologram is going to appear in a few seconds, but how is it going to take place?

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:57.920
CVI: We have a very large stage with a veil on the center of which the hologram is going to be projected.

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:01.640
This is high technology, because the future starts today..

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:09.220
The room is completely full in front of me.
All the seats are taken, I can't see the terraces in the back.

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:12.340
Some people are standing, people are everywhere.

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:18.100
A lot of activists came here today.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.800
Charlotte Girard: There's lots of people here too.

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:32.820
Our Mélenchon is going to stand here, in the center of this arch when the floodlights are turned on,

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:37.620
and as soon as they are, he'll be in Paris in a snap!

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:45.900
GT: Both rooms are incredible!

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:51.920
I assure you that the view is amazing, there are so many of you, I love this view,

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:59.220
and I'd like to share it with you, let's take a picture here in Lyon and Paris!

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:02.800
We'll post it on Twitter with the #JLMhologramme hashtag.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:10.160
Let's share this view with everyone,
especially with those who would not believe it.

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:12.120
We'll show them on the social media.

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:15.760
Let's take a video from Lyon and from Paris!

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Make some noise so that we hear you!

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:26.180
And there we are! I'm posting it right now on Twitter with the #JLMHologramme hashtag.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:31.140
#JLMHologramme is the hashtag we'll be using this afternoon in Lyon and Paris.

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:40.460
CG: It's about to begin!

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.780
GT: Yes it is! It begins!

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.920
Make some noise! This is a world premiere!

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:50.940
There he is, as promised. We do keep our promises!

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:55.680
It's a brilliant feat of engeneering that illustrates the state of mind of our bold and inventive campaign.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.700
Here comes our candidate, the candidate of La France Insoumise!

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:02.160
Please make some noise to welcome Jean-Luc Mélenchon!

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:15.040
Jean-Luc Mélenchon: It looks good!

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:19.320
Hi Eliott!

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:22.020
You all right girls? You managed to survive!

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.180
Audience: Resistance! Resistance! Resistance!

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:26.800
CG: Wow wow wow!

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:53.280
Audience: Resistance! Resistance! Resistance!

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:54.940
JLM: Thank you!

00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:56.980
So...

00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:59.480
Where am I?

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:01.900
Can you hear me?

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:03.500
Audience: Yes!

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:05.580
JLM: It's unbelievable!

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.500
So where am I?

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:10.160
Audience: You're in Lyon!

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:12.680
Am I in Lyon?

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:14.540
Audience: Yes!

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:18.600
JLM: And now, I'm in Paris!

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:53.740
You are doing an extraordinary show of force.

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:58.960
You are showing that you are strong and patient.

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:01.320
This force doesn't come from nowhere.

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:05.400
It comes from an accumulated human and political experience

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:13.900
that we wanted to call into play again for the fight a year ago,

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:22.660
with a wealth of accumulated experience during so many fights and after so many treasons!

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:31.400
We have wanted to build a force,
and we are about to succeed.

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:35.060
A force that learns, that knows why it fights.

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:42.040
A force that is not committed to a man, but to a cause, to an idea that has lived throughout centuries.

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:54.540
I will die one day, but the ideas that I represent will not, not as long as there's a breath of freedom,

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:58.640
that is, not as long as there is a human being to look over the horizon.

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:11.740
This force built itself on the basis of the 230,000 people who now support my candidacy

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:14.040
and the program "L'Avenir en commun" (Common Future).

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:23.220
700 volunteers joined their forces to professionals between Lyon and Paris to make these rallies possible.

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:25.980
Yes, this rally is not like other rallies.

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:32.560
It is not like other rallies because of the form it takes.

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:35.120
There is this hologram.

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:42.020
I heard that some grumps said it looked like showbusiness too much.

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:52.280
But an emancipatory and exploring political message has to rely on the techniques of our time,

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:54.520
techniques that must make us dream and smile.

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:59.280
And let me reassure you, no one is deceived, people in Paris know I'm not there.

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:06.880
My only clone is me, but I know people who are the clones of other people

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:20.120
This rally stands out from other rallies because of a context, a local context more particularly.

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:26.780
This weekend, the three political families that share and contend for the support of the French people were in Lyon.

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:33.820
We've been trying to gain this support month after month, week after week, with precise arguments.

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:35.780
Who are these families?

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:39.660
First, there's Mrs. Le Pen, with...

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:51.600
...with her ethnic communitarianism that is basted with a heavy touch of family clanship.

00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:57.460
You know this, it's the traditional far-right.

00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:00.560
Traditionally bad!

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:09.520
And then there's Mr. Macron, who brilliantly emboddies...

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:15.800
What's going to happen if I list them all?

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:18.120
Mr. Fillon?

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:21.280
No, he's not in Lyon this weekend!

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:25.540
I was talking about Mr. Macron because he too emboddies a kind of thought.

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:29.240
It is the kind of thought that has made us suffer so cruelly for the last thirty years.

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:35.040
It is liberalism, a world where it is every man for himself, where everybody competes with everybody else,

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:41.700
where social indifference rules, with a few friendly ecological ideas of no consequence now and then,

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:49.680
because after all, as you know, what matters above all to these people is competitiveness, flexibility and austerity,

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:52.420
and to produce before sharing out,

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:57.540
as if we had not spent our life producing while we did not receive much!

00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:09.980
It's your call!

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.880
You're about to make a choice in a crucial moment.

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:15.280
We already lost ten years!

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:22.040
The 21st century has already begun, and we are still using outdated intellectual mechanisms.

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:26.660
Our political elites are all cast in the same obsolete mold!

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:34.020
We need to kick them out as quickly and quietly as possible!

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:41.800
And this process is already well under way!

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:46.480
It's already under way during this presidential campaign.

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:49.620
The candidates all have things to hide,
it looks like they're playing hide and seek!

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:59.060
But it's above all a wave that I called a "kick-outist wave", in reference to my Tunisian friends.

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:02.600
"Kick-outism" consists in kicking them out!

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:09.540
But we must give some content to this "kick-outist" wave.

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:19.680
We must get the French people involved, because if the people chooses to give us the possibility to decide,

00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:21.900
then we'll have to take our responsibility,

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:27.720
and not from above, i.e. from the action of a man and the handful of people around him,

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:38.180
but from the involvement of millions of people who'll carry the civic revolution we need on their workplace and everywhere they'll go.

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:44.080
Dont' believe for one moment...

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:55.380
You who are used to obey the law, who are real democrats and who accept sometimes to lose an election

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:59.920
They never accept to lose, financial powers will never accept to lose,

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:05.340
and you who are in this room, outside and in Paris, you are my bulwark!

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:07.400
Why?

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:09.300
Why?

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:16.260
Not because they would rally to my white plume, but because all of you will know what you'll have to do,

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:20.120
because you'll know what function to occupy and because you'll have understood the program.

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:24.000
This is why we must always talk about ideas!

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:27.880
It took us eight months to make this program.

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:34.640
There were thousands of contributions, we heard specialists, and we held a convention that approved it.

00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:39.780
The programme is made up of 357 propositions that are gathered in this book.

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:44.220
Even now, everyone can read it, criticize it and improve it.

00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:51.040
Forty booklets develop the program in detail for each topic, because a book like this cannot go to the bottom of things.

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:53.140
Why am I saying this?

00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:59.220
It is because our movement must rely on awareness and education,

00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:08.740
and not on sudden enthusiasms and magic mushrooms that grow in the political jungle of media bubbles!

00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:13.540
This is the price of efficiency!

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:24.280
You have 78 days left to commit yourselves before the presidential election,

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:30.860
taking into account the reality of the presidential monarchy, that fell into hands... hmmm...

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:33.960
hmm... that lacked confidence.

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:40.180
For ten years, they have failed on almost every subject.

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:49.480
Remember that the next five years will be decisive for the future of our country,

00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:52.320
but also for the rest of the world.

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:57.260
In the next five years, a new European treaty will be presented.

00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:06.940
In the next five years, the TAFTA treaty with the USA and the CETA treaty with Canada will be presented,

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:12.620
according to which any independent economic policy whatsoever becomes impossible!

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:21.860
In these conditions, you must carefully choose whether you want to carry on or to break from this,

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:26.040
and "L'Avenir en commun" emboddies this break with old habits.

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:34.200
It is unbelievable that only 78 days from the election, we still have to run after some people

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:41.240
who try to seek refuge after they were kicked out and who leave us with no basis for discussion.

00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:43.240
Where are their programs?

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:44.360
That's enough!

00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:47.680
Give them to us! Tell us what you intend to do!

00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:53.220
Just uttering a few well-intentioned sentences now and then is not enough!

00:29:53.300 --> 00:30:00.440
Tell us what articulates all these programs we hear about—I mean these measures—that you propose!

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:03.740
They do not form a coherent whole.

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:06.820
Tell me how you could do this or that,

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:11.180
give this or that, launch such and such plan.

00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:17.820
As long as you obey the European budgetary treaties,
no progressive policy is possible!

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:22.000
We must withdraw from European treaties!

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:27.240
It is a prerequisite for change.

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:33.440
Of course, we need to do that in conditions that correspond to our homeland's vocation,

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:36.720
we can't do that on our own, fleeing on the sly.

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:40.060
We must explain, negotiate and make other countries do the same.

00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:43.240
But if the protests of the French people are not heard,

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:47.520
this people whose industry was devastated and who was impoverished like we can see it today,

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:50.220
then we must either change the EU or leave it!

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:56.440
Everyone has to understand that there is no other way than changing!

00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:08.540
To those who would not be satisfied by the program, let me tell you that

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:15.540
next February 19th, we will spend 6 hours explaining the program's budget

00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:20.060
because it is a very ambitious program and because it is a complete change.

00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:24.420
You know the premises. First, we need to change the system of the presidential monarchy

00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:26.040
—I'll come back to this in a moment.

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:33.560
Secondly, we need to share the wealth in such a way that the imbalance that makes

00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:40.440
that there are more billionaires and millionaires in this country than ever before while there are 9 million poor,

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:46.520
while 148,000 people no longer have an address, while 2 million people are waiting for housing.

00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:53.480
All these things ruin the life of people for no reason whereas the country is so rich!

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:02.540
We will never be able to produce as we used to,

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:07.460
except if we turn completely crazy and if we don't care about the future of the planet.

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:15.880
Ecological planning, that scared so many people who looked at me with suspicion when they heard the word 'planning',

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:21.480
because it made them think of USSR, although they forget that General De Gaulle did make plans,

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:28.240
to say nothing of Americans and of all the big companies in the world who have always planned their activities.

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:33.260
We won't be able to plan the ecological transition if we do not make plans, to say so is a lie!

00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:36.080
We need to make plans, and consequently anticipate,

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:41.180
and consequently regain control over the long term, which is a public property.

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:54.340
Finally, to avoid quoting all the program, we are acting for peace.

00:32:54.960 --> 00:33:00.420
We don't want a war in Europe.
We dont' want to go to war with Russia

00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:07.400
We're asking you to leave us in peace when we say so
and to stop calling us Mr Putin's henchmen,

00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:11.880
because he's not ruling our country and because we have nothing to do with him in this matter.

00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:14.380
Do I always have to remember...

00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:21.940
that Russians are our partners, that they contributed to free us,

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:28.140
and that their regime is their business,
just as our regime is our business.

00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:34.120
In any case, accepting the insane idea of a European defence is out of the question.

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:38.380
They came up with this idea to substitute it to the fading dream of Europe.

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:43.380
There they go again with their so-called European defense project, but against whom should we defend ourselves ?

00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:48.060
The Europe of defense is the Europe of war,
but we are in favor of the Europe of peace!

00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:52.400
France should in no way be a war tank for any army whatsoever!

00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:07.720
When we organized this rally and asked you to take part, I had the idea of closing a cycle.

00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:15.440
This is the 16th speech I give since September,
and speech after speech,

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:23.160
after a long team work, we highlight such and such point that seems important and that makes people think,

00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:28.220
in order to spur people's appetite to find out more about the program by reading it.

00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:32.980
This is an educational campaign,
not an hallucinogenic one.

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:36.860
And  now...

00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:50.700
I thought—before taking a five days off—that I would use this rally to look high above the horizon.

00:34:51.600 --> 00:35:01.160
I just told you about the outline of the program,
but you all know the challenges that we'll have to meet.

00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:08.340
The challenges of peace and climate change, which is already under way

00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:14.120
and already caused a flow of 20 million refugees

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:20.440
on the 60 million refugees that are currently roaming about the world in abominable conditions.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.080
We must also meet the challenge of sharing the tremendous wealth

00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:31.260
that is not only morally scandalous for us who belong to the side of human emancipation,

00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:38.320
but that hinders any attempt at a coordinated development of the planet that swarms with human beings,

00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:43.540
because you know that there were hardly 2 billion human beings on the planet in 1950,

00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:46.680
whereas we are now 7 billion,
and we'll soon be 11 billion human beings.

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:54.920
We are exerting huge demographic pressure as a battle for raw materials is taking shape and raging everywhere,

00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:59.100
but we are having discussions that are of secondary importance

00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:04.880
compared to the great challenges that will completely transform the fate of the upcoming century.

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:07.540
Yes, completely!

00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:14.100
As we think about these challenges, we must take into account that the issues we have known until now

00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:18.440
will apply to new fronts and to new frontiers.

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:26.600
The human civilization is threatened, but it has the means to overcome the crisis it is currently going through

00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:31.120
because of climate change and other factors that disrupt the human ecosystem.

00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:39.080
These disruptions are nothing but the result of greed and the will to appropriate everything, everywhere,

00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:40.540
you and I know this.

00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:47.300
Well look how this battle for ownership and selfishness moved to new frontiers.

00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:48.960
History unfolds quickly.

00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:54.020
The human civilization is undergoing a phenomenon that we call the acceleration of history,

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:56.540
we are all more or less aware of it.

00:36:56.720 --> 00:37:02.480
Please try to remember the changes that occurred in your life,

00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:05.840
changes that you could have never imagined as a child.

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:11.140
My grandmother used to go to the local bal in Staoueli by horse-drawn cart.

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:15.140
She was brought back France by plane.

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:21.400
She could read in the newspapers that Yuri Gagarin was the first man to cross the space frontier.

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:28.120
As for me, I came to COP1 by plane—this was not very ecological I know.

00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:35.680
I travelled in President Mitterand's Concorde aircraft, and it took us 3 hours to get from Paris to Rio.

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:40.180
I was in Baikonur to see Jean-Loup Chrétien—the first French astronaut—taking off for space.

00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:42.080
History is accelerating.

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:48.400
I said that the human civilization would enter oceans in one of my books, and it did!

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:55.040
I said that we human beings gather on the edge of the frontier, and we cross it, that's the way it has always happened,

00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:59.660
and that's the way it happens with the sea, and consequently, a battle begins,

00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:03.400
and the same happens with space.
These are not irrelevant issues!

00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:08.820
You will have to face these issues very soon—you are even facing them right now,

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:11.840
because you may have come here using a GPS,

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:15.940
which shows that you are already connected to space and to the satellites that revolve around the Earth.

00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:19.120
But something even more incredible happened.

00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:26.520
We usually discovered continents and got a foothold on them—I won't remind you how we did this—but we did,

00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:30.140
and now, a continent is getting a foothold on us.

00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:34.540
It reshapes our tastes, our moods and our desires.

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:36.740
This continent is the digital continent.

00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:39.340
These are the new frontiers.

00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:42.840
The stakes are high.

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:46.080
These frontiers have to do with our freedom.

00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:55.100
They have to do with the possibility of sharing all the joys we can share and all the wealth we can produce.

00:38:55.920 --> 00:39:01.080
Yes, these new frontiers of humanity do concern the presidential election.

00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:07.060
France is never as great as when it considers itself a part of universal humanity.

00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:10.080
We are not here to make chauvinistic statements,

00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:16.060
we are here to think ourselves with our level of culture, education and preparation,

00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:19.520
with the tremendous wealth that was accumulated by our elders.

00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:23.660
We are here to meet our responsibilities towards universal humanity,

00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:27.720
not only as French, but also as human beings.

00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:34.820
Yes!

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:40.040
I am saying all this because we are going to do it!

00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:43.000
If we are entrusted with the task of governing the country,

00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:47.080
we will do this with enthusiasm,
and we'll stop feeling ashamed

00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:51.040
because of all these people who spend their time making everyone feel guilty

00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:55.860
by saying that workers don't work, that France doesn't make any progress, that the French are ignorant.

00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:57.280
and that our school system is worth nothing.

00:39:57.380 --> 00:40:03.040
This rally should therefore be a hymn of love to the history of France and to who we are:

00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:06.240
France, the country that invented the Declaration of Human Rights,

00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:10.900
France, the eldest daughter of social security and secular school.

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:23.680
But we can only cross these frontiers...

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:31.040
Look at them! Frontiers usually divide, but they can also unite us.

00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:32.940
How shall we do that?

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:42.260
Nothing will be possible in this century if every human being doesn't reach the highest level of education.

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:47.200
Education consists in sharing knowledge,

00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:52.100
and knowledge is the only thing that grows as we share it.

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:57.080
Humanity develops through what we call cumulative culture,

00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:02.400
which makes humanity stand out from other animal species, including social animals.

00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:07.280
We share knowledge, and we are able to pass it down from generation to generation.

00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:10.380
This is even easier now that we overcame the limits of time,

00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:13.560
because in the past, knowledge was only stored in the heads of wise men,

00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:18.600
and one day, Mr Gutenberg helped us overcoming the limits of time thanks to writing.

00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:21.180
Let's give it some thought.

00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:24.260
We can't do anything without knowledge,

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:31.120
and knowledge is not only the things we learn at school or at the university.

00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:37.480
Knowledge is a way of being fully human, and to develop all our aspects of human beings.

00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:43.140
Knowledge is nothing if it is not preceded by a culture that shapes our heart and our mind,

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:47.640
that unleashes our imagination and that constantly develops our appetite for knowledge.

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:54.400
If it is not shared, without culture and above all without creators, knowledge is worth nothing!

00:41:54.680 --> 00:42:04.720
In the procession of human history, the poets and the musicians are walking before us,

00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:11.240
and they are accompanied by highly skilled workers and all those who keep the country going day in, day out.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.000
So, Mrs Le Pen...

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:20.000
Who gave you such an idea?

00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:24.780
How could you believe that this could be a good idea?

00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:31.120
How could you believe that preventing foreigners' children from going to school could be a good idea?

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:42.260
Who can believe that a society gets better when people become more ignorant?

00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:45.680
Only an ignorant can believe that!

00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:52.860
I clearly see...

00:42:55.080 --> 00:43:00.160
Another of her absurd ideas proves it.

00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:06.340
She said that pupils should devote 50 % of their school time to learning the French language.

00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:08.640
50 % of their school time?

00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:10.760
So what language do they speak during the remaining
50 %?

00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:15.380
Doesn't she know that we learn a language through practice?

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:22.380
Pupils learn the French language during their whole school time, by studying mathematics, history and geography!

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:28.980
Do you want these people to govern your country?

00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:30.660
Come on!

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:41.720
We will not only teach all the pupils in our schools to read, write, count, love, write poems and play music,

00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:44.280
because it will make us better people,

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:50.340
but besides, we will redesign the school catchment area to avoid rich and poor ghettos,

00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:52.500
thanks to the republican school!

00:43:55.960 --> 00:44:03.460
We will guarantee a free access to education in all its aspects,

00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:10.940
and we will get rid of this new tax on people that is disguised as a measure on school timetables,

00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:15.180
a tax for taking care of their children, whereas they should be in school!

00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:23.300
That's not all!

00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:29.780
In addition to that, every child from 3 to 18 will attend school,

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:34.720
because we need them to learn seriously and thoroughly.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:39.100
Earlier children are enrolled in school, earlier they get socialized.

00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:42.000
That doesn't mean that we have to ram socialism down their throats,

00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:44.440
it means that we include them in the human community.

00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:51.360
What children need in the first place is human interaction, to learn all the codes and understand what makes this human community

00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:57.920
otherwise they become violent, and therefore they need human presence, not to be put in front of television.

00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:06.080
And because I take these questions very seriously...
—I can tell because I have known them closely—

00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:13.740
When they study, students must have time and resources to do so. They should not have to work at the same time.

00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:19.260
The 50% of young people who work and study at the same time are wearing themselves out!

00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:24.320
That is not good! That is not good!

00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:30.520
Only the rich think that other people's hard work is a good thing!

00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:37.700
So we have to put in place an independent student allowance. And there will be one.

00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:42.880
In addition to that... In addition to that...

00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:56.020
As far as vocational education is concerned, where the average age is often a bit higher than in other studies,

00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:05.420
well, I want to put an end to the fact that 100 % of people of an age group , or 100% of a promotion

00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:09.760
be forced to work every evening and every weekend while they study.

00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:17.980
That is why all the students from 16 years old who are in vocational education will be entitled to this student allowance.

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:27.520
Ah Ah! Here is something which is going to change the distribution of social roles in this country!

00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:37.440
My friends, we need 60.000 more professors and teachers of all sorts, to compensate those we lost under Sarkozy,

00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:42.820
and those who have not been replaced by François Hollande.

00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:45.860
And you know, I will not content myself with saying that.

00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:51.980
You are applauding but on February 19th, you will come and ask how much it costs, because everybody is going to ask about the cost.

00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:57.040
What is the cost of stupidity? What is the cost of death?

00:46:57.580 --> 00:47:00.920
What are those unilateral accountancies?

00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:03.340
We need professors.

00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:07.780
Hiring people to educate children enriches the country, it does not impoverish it.

00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:10.840
Knowledge is an Investment, not an expense!

00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:16.780
There's something else I'll to tell you!

00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:20.960
When I was a young man— yes it happened once...

00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:33.340
When we did not have a lot of money but were talented for school and wanted to make a career

00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:38.060
well we would go to "Ecole Normale" (teacher's training college).

00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:42.160
We would go there after 16 and we would get a salary,

00:47:42.620 --> 00:47:53.300
so that both teachers and pupils in those colleges were coming from the same social background.

00:47:54.180 --> 00:48:00.160
But when we are required—I understand this although I don't always agree with it—

00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:05.640
to have a master's degree level to be able to become a professor,

00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:12.340
well I know that families have to be able to dedicate an important part of their income

00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:16.000
to help their child until graduation to become a professor.

00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:21.740
What I suggest is that we use a pre-recruitment system again.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:27.140
We will pre-recruit people of 16 or 17, we will give them a salary,

00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:33.480
and they will owe 10 years of service to the country's schools to which they will be assigned to go and teach.

00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:39.840
Thus, they will have the same color and they will look like the whole French people.

00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:46.600
I told you about how to build knowledge.

00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:54.720
I fume at the way thugs talk about research,
whereas we have accumulated so much knowledge.

00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:58.480
Have you heard them giggling: "Ah Ah you've searched enough, now it is time to find".

00:48:58.600 --> 00:48:59.940
They are thugs!

00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:02.660
The mind won't let itself be indoctrinated.

00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:07.880
The first thing we must say is that if we respect research and practical sciences,

00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:15.480
then we have a very long-term interest in having a free French basic research,

00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:22.540
in which researchers are not asked every 5 minutes when the patent they work on can be marketed!

00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:29.360
You need freedom of thought rather than freedom of trade!

00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:31.820
Yes, freedom of thought,

00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:35.380
because there are important challenges ahead of us that we must solve.

00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:39.240
If we want to phase out nuclear power—and we want to!—

00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:44.020
not to blame those who developped it, but because it's dangerous!

00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:49.920
We can do this, and those who built these nuclear power plants can help us stop them.

00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:55.800
My friends, it will take 20 to 25 years to dismantle nuclear power plants,

00:49:55.920 --> 00:50:01.320
and in the meantime will come other means of producing energy thanks to ecological planning.

00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:05.200
But what is going to happen to nuclear wastes?
We don't even know what to do with them!

00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:08.840
Ten years later, we are still working on the very first nuclear power plant we began to dismantle.

00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:16.680
Therefore, we need basic nuclear research to understand the radiation mechanism and stop it,

00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:20.240
otherwise, we will have this rubbish on our hands for the next 10,000 years!

00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:23.100
We need free basic research.

00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:31.720
We need educated minds that look for solutions, that make research, and that sometimes make unexpected discoveries.

00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:38.000
We need to stop considering that research is linked to private companies

00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:44.300
And enough with this research tax credit!
Do you know about it?

00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:46.980
No you don't know? Well let me inform you that there is one!

00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:53.400
Who benefitted from the money that we gave away like that? I had a look at the list and what did I see? Banks!

00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:58.460
Do these people still need to learn anything about the art of robbing other people? It's a good question!

00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:02.180
And yet they were given money.
This is unacceptable!

00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:11.000
These funds have to be dedicated to research. These funds have to be dedicated to our most sacred tasks.

00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:14.940
I don't want to close this part without telling you about this.

00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:20.440
We are this great country, with so many poets, writers, scientists and Fields medals!

00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:24.440
We won more Fields medals than any country.

00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:27.600
Our CNRS is the best research center in the world.

00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:31.580
So tell me, where does this indifference come from,

00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:39.600
that makes us let 2.5 million people to suffer from illiteracy in our country?

00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:45.000
We will start a campaign—a campaign like those that were carried in third world countries if we have to,

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.460
and with their help, because they're better at it—

00:51:47.620 --> 00:51:53.800
to get all those who can't read out of illiteracy by the end of the upcoming presidential term!

00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:58.000
Being illiterate doesn't mean you are stupid.

00:51:58.820 --> 00:52:00.400
It doesn't mean you are ignorant.

00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:02.360
It doesn't mean you don't have knowledge.

00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:07.440
It just means that you can't read and write fluently.

00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:11.780
Therefore, there are considerable treasures of imagination and intelligence

00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:15.060
that are taken from the human collectivity, just for that reason!

00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:19.020
We must make up for this, and make it one of our priorities

00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:26.820
—no matter the skin color, no matter the religion, no matter the origins of those who are in that situation!

00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:32.320
Earlier, I said: "Ha, ha!"...

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:38.240
"Ha, ha!"—They turned off the stopwatch, so this rally can last for hours

00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:42.080
Earlier, I told you that knowledge was nothing without culture.

00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:43.680
Yes!

00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:46.180
There are other people who talk about culture.

00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:58.100
It makes me laugh, because the media and political world steeps in a goldfish atmosphere,

00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:03.600
Nobody ever remembers anything,
nor compares anything with something else.

00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:10.740
However, when it is about going into raptures or being delighted, people are very much enclined to do so.

00:53:11.100 --> 00:53:14.100
So I heard Mr Macron talking about culture.

00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:22.000
To be honest, when technocrats and bankers take an interest in culture, I usually am suspicious.

00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:27.720
What are they going to invent to poison people's life and rob them?

00:53:29.020 --> 00:53:36.920
Well he suggested something that I find remarkable for a liberal who doesn't believe in state power as we do.

00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:42.180
He suggested that people celebrating their 18th birthday—this is not a vote-catching proposition of course!—

00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:50.500
would be awarded a 500 euros check by the state to be spent in cultural products and activities.

00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:57.860
I don't know how many people worked on this idea.

00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:08.200
But wait! They missed a part of the reasoning—it's my turn to have a laugh.

00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:12.560
They say: "We have to produce before sharing out!",

00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:16.400
as if we had never produced anything in this country and were just about to do it

00:54:16.740 --> 00:54:19.720
because these "important" people ordered us to do so.

00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:26.600
It's my turn to have a laugh and to say that before giving out checks to be spent in cultural activities,

00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:29.640
we have to produce them to begin with!

00:54:32.900 --> 00:54:42.860
And you don't produce culture like you make bolts. Or vaults—no, not vaults, it was for the rhyme.

00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:49.040
Culture is like a delicate flower, it grows in people's minds,

00:54:49.100 --> 00:54:51.420
and it won't grow if people are forced to appreciate it.

00:54:52.380 --> 00:54:56.120
And for something to grow, it has to be fed a lot to begin with.

00:54:56.240 --> 00:55:03.360
You need to listen to music, to go to the theater, to read books, to look at statues,

00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:05.820
Etc, etc, etc.

00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:10.900
Before being spread—which is very important—culture must be produced!

00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:15.260
And now, I'm going to reveal something else that is very important  to these people .

00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:20.680
Creation does not come out of the blue, there has to be people who create,

00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:24.260
but to do that, they need to be able to live with dignity.

00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:36.060
Therefore, the first task of a cultural policy is to make sure that creators are able to live with dignity

00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:41.800
We must stop intimidating creators who have the insecure status of "intermittent du spectacle"

00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:45.240
by constantly telling them they could lose their status

00:55:45.540 --> 00:55:53.480
On the contrary, we must draw our inspiration from this status to imagine what the status of independent creator could be

00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:59.560
in other fields of artistic creation like writing, comics writing or whatnot...

00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:03.680
That is why—since all this costs money,

00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:08.940
and you know that we have to answer when it gets to the cost of things...

00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:12.120
Some don't!

00:56:12.980 --> 00:56:18.640
Because Mr Macron doesn't seem to be worried about the fact that the state give 500 euros to people on their 18th birthday!

00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:26.340
I mean, if the culture industry was only made of big production companies, the money would circulate in closed circuit.

00:56:26.700 --> 00:56:30.660
But since we advocate a different organization, we see things differently, obviously.

00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:35.820
By the way, I heard he came up with another idea—this guy really has extraordinary obsessions!

00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:38.200
He said: "People should read!"
Good!

00:56:38.820 --> 00:56:44.780
"Therefore, libraries should be open on Saturdays and Sundays!"

00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:50.740
On Saturdays? But it's already the case!

00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:57.560
So all he wants is people to work on Sundays, because there are librarians who work in libraries,

00:56:58.340 --> 00:57:01.480
and without librarians, libraries wouldn't exist!

00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:05.380
He didn't think about it!

00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:10.700
When these guys have ideas, they can't be stopped!

00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:18.400
This one ruined the life of thousands of people by participating in the writing of the El Khomri Labor law.

00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:22.980
He ruined the life of thousands of people with his Uber-like inventions!

00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:29.760
But now he just added a new professional category who are going to join our cause: librarians!

00:57:35.540 --> 00:57:37.620
Here is what we should do.

00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:43.120
Holland's government is the only government of the past ten years that made cuts in the culture budget.

00:57:43.980 --> 00:57:48.380
We should stop dithering and debating... All this is over!

00:57:48.740 --> 00:57:55.180
We must stay a course and go back to the idea of dedicating 1 % of the country's wealth to culture,

00:57:55.660 --> 00:57:59.580
to develop it, to spread it, to instil it in people.

00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:05.660
I propose that we create five to six thousand classes focusing on cultural and artistic purposes,

00:58:05.660 --> 00:58:11.620
which will allow to get the external cultural partners involved and raise the cultural level of our youths.

00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:14.260
Listen people!

00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:20.940
A few days ago, I went to the International Comics Festival in Angoulême.

00:58:21.860 --> 00:58:24.960
I love cartoons, I guess I'm not the only one here.

00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:35.840
So we talked a lot, and someone told me that 30% of comics writers lived below the poverty line.

00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:41.320
Don't believe that making comics is as easy as abc.
It's a long process.

00:58:42.100 --> 00:58:45.880
And you seem to like it, because French people read comics a lot.

00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:48.740
We need creators to be able to work, you know that.

00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:56.500
Those who write comics blow our minds and feed our imagination—you often buy the comics you skimmed!

00:58:57.260 --> 00:59:03.620
And above all, they produce the raw material that is going to be developped, processed, worked

00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:07.260
by those who make video games—I will come to this point in a moment.

00:59:07.460 --> 00:59:14.000
They are working on a brand new continent for education and life as we see them for the 21st century.

00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:15.960
In short, these people are essential!

00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:17.940
So how are we going to do this?

00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:23.000
They had an idea that I adopted and suggested  to my friends who work in the cultural committee

00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:25.300
who wrote our booklet about culture.

00:59:26.580 --> 00:59:29.780
You can read for further information.

00:59:30.380 --> 00:59:31.640
And here is the idea.

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:37.300
In order to fund these cooperatives of independent creators,

00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:43.540
or such and such type of association that would suit these creators,

00:59:43.720 --> 00:59:47.040
because we need to trust them to come up with new ideas in this domain.

00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:53.500
Creators are often independent people—not always— but they are rather used to work on their own.

00:59:53.940 --> 00:59:54.900
But not all of them!

00:59:55.700 --> 01:00:01.600
As a consequence, we must respect this. We can't be authoritarian and tell them to do this or that.

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:06.800
They have to develop themselves independently, but the resource we advocate is as follows.

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:11.920
I'm presenting it for the first time this afternoon.

01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:18.500
When a work of art has been distributed for a certain number of years,

01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:26.180
it enters into the public domain, which means that the heirs of the author can no longer get royalties.

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:30.440
Because often, the author is dead. First problem!

01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:37.060
You must be waiting for the rest, right?

01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:43.680
After a certain period, this work enters into the public domain.

01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:46.500
Here is my proposition.

01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:53.100
It will never enter any public domain that is not a common domain. Let me explain.

01:00:53.720 --> 01:01:00.680
On these works that no longer entitle heirs to get royalties according to the present intellectual property law,

01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:05.780
after this time limit—40, 50, and even 70 years, as is suggested by the EU,

01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:11.080
that absolutely wants publishers to get as many royalties as they can,

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:15.000
well we would grant the same rights as before—a bit less maybe—

01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:21.160
and these royalties would feed a fund that would contribute to creators' social situation.

01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:25.600
This is what we call socializing the public domain of creation.

01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:29.360
Did everyone understand?

01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:33.560
How much does it cost?

01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:42.480
This would enable thousands of creators to live, and more particularly to fund their retirement pensions.

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:51.980
This is very important. We all aspire to security, which led my friends and I to conceive a full social security

01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:55.220
that would cover 100 % of healthcare reimbursements,

01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:59.640
and that would enable people who paid contributions for 40 years to retire at the age of 60.

01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:05.060
Why should the members of the human elite who entertain us and  feed our minds should live in misery

01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:08.560
just because their creations are not enough to provide for their basic needs?

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:15.240
We can be more ambitious if we want to!

01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:18.940
Do you know who came up with this idea?

01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:21.200
There's a copyright!

01:02:23.380 --> 01:02:25.080
No, it's not Karl Marx!

01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:29.560
It's Victor Hugo, my friends. The great Victor Hugo!

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:38.240
His opponents told him: "What are you doing Mr Hugo?
You are attacking private property!"

01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:43.680
He answered: "Whose property? As long as an author is alive, he get royalties!"

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.200
-"But what if he's dead?"
-Victor Hugo: "Well that's the point!"

01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:51.840
Victor Hugo was more ambitious than the measure I just told you about.

01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:55.320
But I give my opponents leeway, I'm already known for wanting to expropriate everything!

01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:58.100
Here is the leeway.

01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:02.740
We'll take the royalties on the works when the author has passed away,

01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:06.020
because why would someone be legitimate for inheriting a work of art?

01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:11.920
OK, let's say that the widow or widower could, but why would someone be legitimate for inheriting a work of art?

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:13.920
To Vicor Hugo, there is no legitimate reason for this.

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:15.760
Let me quote him.

01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:18.880
"He who inherits blood inherits blood".

01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:24.720
He was refering to writers. "The writer as a writer has only one heir, the heir of the spirit,

01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:30.480
the human spirit, that is, the public domain. That is the absolute truth!"

01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:47.500
When I was in Angoulême, someone suggested this idea that we'll advocate from now on.

01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:56.100
We will be the first generation to have a global system that enables every creator to live with dignity,

01:03:56.340 --> 01:04:04.260
and consequently to live for the sole purpose of doing what they do,

01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:06.780
something we need badly, their cultural productions.

01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:10.560
We'll be the ones who do it, within the framework of our programme, "L'Avenir en commun" (Common Future).

01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:11.440
All right!

01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:18.620
I was in Angoulême, and woosh, I went to the public school of video games—because there is one!

01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:21.420
This leads me to the digital world.

01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:27.560
I'd better not mix up the papers.

01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:32.160
Yes, video games are a new world.

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:36.580
I really want to tell you about it.
It is a total experience.

01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:43.380
The worldwide budget of the video games industry today is more important than that of the cinema industry!

01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:46.560
It enables users to live a total experience.

01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:49.300
It enabled me to climb a frozen mountain.

01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:54.040
I tried not to get too close from the edge because I have a fear of heights.

01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:57.160
And then someone told me: "You see, this is a therapeutic instrument".

01:04:57.620 --> 01:05:01.500
It enables users to learn faster because it is a total experience,

01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:05.200
and French developers are among the best in the world,

01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:14.680
which is why—considering how extraordinary this tool is for learning and developping culture—it is a challenge for the 21st century!

01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:20.800
This sector is still in its infancy in France, but it should become a state-of-the-art industry of our homeland.

01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:23.620
Thousands of people must get to work, and they already are,

01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:27.620
and if you see them working—I the former teacher feel concerned!

01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:33.760
I saw a young woman with a bachelor's degree in English who was working with a young digital engineer,

01:05:33.900 --> 01:05:36.500
and the two of them were doing something unusual,

01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:43.040
they had an open way of working, one knew what the other was doing, whereas their work was purely intellectual,

01:05:43.220 --> 01:05:50.120
as if they were on a building site, where a plumber, knowing what the plasterer and the painter are doing,

01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:53.340
adapts his work accordingly and makes his own demands.

01:05:53.540 --> 01:05:56.860
This extraordinary collaboration filled me with enthusiasm,

01:05:56.900 --> 01:06:01.040
and it showed how inventive these video games will be when they come out,

01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:03.160
because these ARE video games—don't laugh!

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:06.580
Humanity as a whole started with your own children,

01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:14.340
as for us, we learned social roles and rituals through games when we were kids, and animals do the same.

01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:18.740
When someone invented such a wonderful technique, it has to be shared.

01:06:18.860 --> 01:06:21.500
Playing is not a waste of time.

01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:26.580
Playing may even be an opportunity for becoming better people. OK, I said it!

01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:29.260
This leads me to the digital world.

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:34.240
This is also a continent.
You must get interested in it people!

01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:38.680
They are now a part of yourself, and you know it.

01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:41.340
You know the GAFAMs.

01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:48.460
Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft. Hmm?

01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:50.380
The GAFAMs.

01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:53.980
These companies are immoral.

01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:57.520
They spend their time avoiding taxes.

01:06:58.180 --> 01:07:00.700
Well, we will no longer authorize them to do so.

01:07:06.460 --> 01:07:13.180
Many of these companies are antisocial,

01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:20.840
because they use internet platforms to undo labor laws and to uberize society as a whole,

01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:25.740
which is apparently an ideal for yuppies like our young banker, Mr Macron.

01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:36.320
We will not let them destroy jobs and make workers do piecework again as in the Middle Ages.

01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:41.020
The solidarity between workers and employees must be protected!

01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:48.660
I heard that everybody wanted to repeal the El Khomri Labor law

01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:52.020
—I said everyone, including the candidate of the Socialist Party (PS)—

01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:59.020
I wonder why the Socialist government doesn't repeal it before leaving office.

01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:12.820
Because some PS deputies presented an amendment to this law that says that internet platforms

01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:20.540
do not have to reclassify those who work for them as permanent employees.

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:24.340
In many cases, the coalition of uberized workers...

01:08:24.380 --> 01:08:29.220
—once the hallucinogenic period has passed in which some them say "Great! I don't have a boss anymore!"

01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:33.160
But as a friend of mine said, yes you have a boss!
It's in your pocket. It's your phone!

01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:37.540
And so you work and you work, for hours and hours,

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:41.460
because you're young and you think your energy is eternal,

01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:45.600
but there's always a time when you worked so much that you end up falling from your bike,

01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:49.460
or having a car accident, etc etc.

01:08:49.700 --> 01:08:51.640
Uberization is a delusion!

01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:54.960
Even if collaboration via internet platforms can be useful,

01:08:54.960 --> 01:09:01.180
they cannot destroy jobs, occupations, and fair compensation.

01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:11.200
Compensation is not a luxury, and employers' contributions are not a favor, but they are human needs.

01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:19.340
We must all pay contributions so that when the time comes, everyone can receive what he needs.

01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:24.840
It's a new continent!

01:09:25.980 --> 01:09:29.780
You must concern yourselves with it and think about it, because it's not a minor issue,

01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:32.160
and it's not a issue for bobos.

01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:34.080
Poor bobos!

01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:38.520
The digital world is invading every aspect of our lives,
and don't tell me you're not aware of it,

01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:45.980
because employees are already asking for the right to disconnect, since it is now considered a favor.

01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:51.660
The right to disconnect means the right to turn off your damn smartphone,

01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:56.740
instead of having to use it all the time, night and day,

01:09:56.820 --> 01:10:03.120
just for showing you're full of enthusiasm, competitive, flexible and busy with work.

01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:08.380
The right to disconnect must be established because for now it's only a favor.

01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:09.900
So... All right!

01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:14.720
We don't have to be invaded, that's not true, but yes, it is an invasion.

01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:20.300
An invasion of our tastes, of our customs, of our social relations, of our friends list.

01:10:20.780 --> 01:10:26.340
Yes it is an invasion. We must set it in order and restore our freedom,

01:10:26.620 --> 01:10:31.700
starting with the right to own personal databases and to have full control over them.

01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:36.020
We refuse that big companies sell them without our consent.

01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:48.360
Our youth must learn the vocabulary of digital technologies in school as we learned grammar before

01:10:48.580 --> 01:10:50.280
because it is the language of the future.

01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:54.420
They must learn the technologies that sustain the digital world,

01:10:54.560 --> 01:11:03.360
but first and foremost, they must learn to look at things with a critical eye,

01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:07.460
they should not let themselves be deceived, misled and fooled!

01:11:11.980 --> 01:11:17.260
Our conception of digital technologies is different.
We call it the common digital world.

01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:24.660
The protection of personal data, net neutrality—maybe you don't know it, but that's their plan for tomorrow,

01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:29.380
they want to make the contents of those who pay more accesible, and those who don't will have to wait.

01:11:29.940 --> 01:11:32.900
Net neutrality consists in forbidding such practices.

01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:41.340
We must forbid it if we want to guarantee the equality of accessibility,  production and diffusion of users and producers.

01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:44.240
These will be major issues of the 21st century.

01:11:44.660 --> 01:11:50.460
They will be decisive for your jobs, your lives, and the way you look at your neighbors or your friends.

01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:54.400
These issues are already out there in the big digital whirl.

01:11:54.580 --> 01:12:01.680
Now is the time to set things straight, to legislate, to study what's going on and to set back our sovereignty again,

01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:06.720
your personal sovereignty, i.e. your personal rights, but also the sovereignty of the state.

01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:15.100
If we win this election, Microsoft will have to forget about its partnership with the Ministry of Education,

01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:18.180
because we will not let them brainwash our kids!

01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:28.960
They should know that we will not implement a single Microsoft software on any of France's independent instrument,

01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:33.120
that is, our military or telecommunication equipment,

01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:39.980
because our government was crazy enough to give Mr Trump access to our activities!

01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:42.280
That's what it's all about!

01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:46.600
Internet must be a public service, a public service of knowledge.

01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:49.940
We cannot let big companies appropriate everything,

01:12:49.940 --> 01:12:53.980
like the rights I talked about earlier, these works that entered the public domain.

01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:58.680
This is the new version of liberty, equality and fraternity.

01:12:58.860 --> 01:13:03.600
We must give back the digital continent to the people,

01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:08.340
because the people created it, takes care of it and maintains it.

01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:14.000
Enough with the globalitarian order that intends to enter our minds to tell us what we have to do!

01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:25.200
Of course it has to do with free softwares and of course we will develop them!

01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:27.720
Why are state administrations not in the vanguard of these issues?

01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:33.180
You cannot live without having access to the internet, you all know this now.

01:13:33.220 --> 01:13:37.260
You are increasingly told that this or that was dematerialized,

01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:42.060
and lots of people don't know what to do, because they don't master these technologies,

01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:48.440
and consequently, we must create public services to give them access to them, and they must be available everywhere.

01:13:48.620 --> 01:13:56.180
To do that, we must substitute fiber-optic communication to satellites that turned the world into a giant microwave.

01:13:56.640 --> 01:14:03.140
We are walking among waves, but we don't know the effects they will have on our health.

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:07.780
Satellites lead me to the space domain.

01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:10.300
You don't even know why!

01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:20.000
Did you know that France ranked second with respect to per capita contributions to the space industry?

01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:22.280
You the French!

01:14:22.660 --> 01:14:28.820
You the good-for-nothing who never have ideas and who are never flexible enough!

01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:34.220
We are great power. An intellectual power, but also a material power.

01:14:34.460 --> 01:14:39.120
Half of jobs in the space industry in Europe are located in France.

01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:45.960
As a consequence, we have duties, responsibilities,
but also great hopes,

01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:50.860
because we are capable of doing everything we need to do for the 21st century.

01:14:51.540 --> 01:14:54.780
Provided that we have the authorization to do so!

01:14:55.300 --> 01:15:01.340
Because it's the people that contributed to the development of rockets, when everybody said it was impossible to do.

01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:05.720
Likewise, it's the people that contributed to develop submarine communication cables,

01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:09.920
the cables that transimt the signals I mentionned earlier when I dealt with the digital world.

01:15:10.220 --> 01:15:18.660
And guess who sold Alcatel-Lucent, the only company we had that could lay cables underwater?

01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:21.940
It was Mr Macron, who's now telling us what we have to!

01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:27.500
These people ruined everything! Who privatized our last public shares in Arianespace?

01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:30.980
It was Mr Macron, who's now telling us what we have to do!

01:15:33.060 --> 01:15:37.700
Yes you can boo him, because it's a lot of dirty tricks for a single man,

01:15:38.020 --> 01:15:43.380
it's a lot of steps backward in the 21st century for people who claim to be modern,

01:15:43.580 --> 01:15:47.440
who aren't even capable of explaining what modernity really is,

01:15:47.540 --> 01:15:52.140
i.e. everything I just talked about, everything that is the future and the potential of our country,

01:15:52.260 --> 01:15:55.720
that will give us the possibility to change the world for our kids,

01:15:55.740 --> 01:15:58.700
and to make it more exciting than what we have known.

01:15:58.860 --> 01:16:04.320
We're used to make a list of everything that is wrong,
but let's think about the splendor of the mind

01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:08.020
that enables us to conquer, to explore and to learn.

01:16:08.540 --> 01:16:10.860
We must take our responsibility.

01:16:11.340 --> 01:16:17.940
France will not let space—that we are exploring and discovering—be privatized!

01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:26.760
France—that was capable of developing Ariane rockets,
that represent 50 % of the world market—

01:16:27.020 --> 01:16:34.120
France wil not accept the privatization of space,
because some would like to privatize it!

01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:37.500
Two powers!

01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:48.920
Two space powers decided that it was possible, contrary to the treaties on space that were in force until now,

01:16:49.420 --> 01:16:55.120
that said space was the common property of all humanity, which is why space brings us together.

01:16:55.700 --> 01:17:02.740
Two great powers decided that a country could appropriate the resources of planets and asteroids

01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:06.320
if it was the first to get there.

01:17:06.900 --> 01:17:10.260
What are these two great space powers?

01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:18.100
The USA took a decision—and you know that when they do that, everyone is supposed to obey them.

01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:25.120
And whether you like it or not, they consider that everything is their property when they arrive somewhere.

01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:31.620
Ask yourself why they planted their damn flag on the Moon in 1969 and did not go back there since.

01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:40.160
But there's another great space power that decided to emancipate all the companies

01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:44.100
that would find something to exploit in space.

01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:48.360
This great space power is the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg!

01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:56.740
It decided to exempt companies that would do that from paying taxes and to be tax-friendly with them.

01:17:57.260 --> 01:18:03.740
You had the good taste of smiling, but honestly,
we're beginning to have it up to here—big time!—

01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:11.260
that the President of the European Commission is the man who has organized tax evasion all over Europe for years

01:18:11.260 --> 01:18:14.060
and who has profited from other countries,
and now I discovered that...

01:18:14.180 --> 01:18:15.500
Yes you can boo him!

01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:18.400
...I discovered that he also wants to do that.

01:18:19.340 --> 01:18:21.340
I said it, we have a responsibility.

01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:25.960
If we want to keep occupying low Earth orbit,

01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:34.640
France must initiate and be in the lead of a remediation campaign of low Earth orbit.

01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:36.280
Did you watch Gravity?

01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:39.440
Come on, answer me!
Audience: Yes!

01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:41.580
JLM: OK, good! But that's not true!

01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:44.020
You can see space pollution in Gravity.

01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:49.100
There's a crewed satellite—we Europeans should do crewed space programmes, why don't we do them?—

01:18:49.260 --> 01:18:53.840
and it is destroyed because of some bolts and spacecraft parts that float in space.

01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:56.040
I told you...

01:18:57.040 --> 01:19:00.260
I told you that we must tackle the issue of space.

01:19:00.820 --> 01:19:01.800
And if we...

01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:05.300
We must tackle this subject because it will set other industries in motion.

01:19:05.420 --> 01:19:13.660
When an industry accumulates intelligence and skills, and requires us to do more than we can do at present...

01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:17.500
We are one of the leading countries—I won't say the leading country—the second maybe,

01:19:17.620 --> 01:19:20.280
with respect to the number of engineers per 100,000 inhabitants.

01:19:20.780 --> 01:19:24.600
I want us to be self-confident,
I want us to know that we can do it!

01:19:24.860 --> 01:19:29.600
We can do something for this new century,
and not by dragging our feet,

01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:34.680
or by letting ourselves be told what we have to do by dog trainers like our current leaders,

01:19:34.900 --> 01:19:36.900
but we'll do it gladly and enthusiastically!

01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:39.760
Gladly and enthusiastically!

01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:41.320
Yep!

01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:45.000
Listen, we are a great power.

01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:47.140
How many times...

01:19:48.020 --> 01:19:50.020
How many times did I talk to you about oceans?

01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:56.400
We are the second maritime power in the world.
Isn't it extraordinary?

01:19:57.920 --> 01:20:01.920
Oceans are huge! They cover 70 % of the planet's surface.

01:20:02.820 --> 01:20:08.500
We have all the means to explore it—the technical means, the scientific means and enough skilled professionals.

01:20:08.940 --> 01:20:18.700
We want to invest a part of the 100 billion euros we want to inject in production in the maritime economy,

01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:21.980
because we will invest 100 billion euros,
whereas other candidates want to take them back!

01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:28.580
Don't they realize? France is already agonizing, but they want to take 100 billion euros more from the economy!

01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:32.660
We will invest 100 billion euros into the economy to make up for budget cuts,

01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:38.220
and a part of this investment will be injected into the maritime economy, to produce seaweeds... We can do everything!

01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:42.260
Starting with this! You don't know it, but it's made of seaweeds.

01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:46.760
And many other things!

01:20:47.340 --> 01:20:53.620
We'll draw energy from oceans! You want to phase out nuclear power, but we cannot stop using electricity to do that!

01:20:53.880 --> 01:21:00.100
As a consequence, we'll have to use different energy resources. We must use 100 % renewable energies,

01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:03.300
and oceans are a huge reservoir of energies!

01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:11.060
They contain 75 times the required amount of energy we need on Earth.

01:21:11.380 --> 01:21:15.840
As a consequence, our only limit is our capacity to invest.

01:21:16.180 --> 01:21:22.100
Our only limit is our capacity to invent, to set machines, wind and marine turbines.

01:21:22.300 --> 01:21:26.120
How come not a single offshore wind turbine was set during the last presidential term?

01:21:26.260 --> 01:21:35.420
How come Mr Macron and co. sold absolutely all the companies that produced wind turbines?

01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:42.440
The only companies we have left are DCNS and a few others that we'll set back to work with our investment plan.

01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:45.440
How come our neighbors have the capacity to do it and not us?

01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:51.280
And yet we'll have to have the equivalent of 15 nuclear reactors by 2030.

01:21:51.820 --> 01:21:59.380
The equivalent of 15 nuclear reactors with maritime energies would create thousands and thousands of jobs.

01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:03.320
The maritime economy employs 300,000 people today.

01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:13.220
I had a discussion with the maritime cluster. They all disagree with me, except on one point.

01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:20.520
If we get to work, we could create from 300 to 400,000 jobs, because we'll have decided to make investments.

01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:28.160
This shows that to run the economy of tomorrow, we don't need to keep on assassinating the planet.

01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:30.820
On the contrary, it would regenerate.

01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:34.760
France must set an exemple.

01:22:35.180 --> 01:22:38.880
It must be in the lead of other nations, take initiatives and have imagination.

01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:41.720
It just produced—we'll show you on March 30th—

01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:46.120
a document that is the equivalent of Diderot's encyclopedia in the18th century,

01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:48.160
that was a real revolution of the mind.

01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:51.160
France will publish a document called "Les Océanides" (The Oceanids).

01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:55.740
278 researchers from all over the world from all sciences and techniques,

01:22:56.080 --> 01:23:01.620
from human to "hard" sciences, archaeologists, paleontologists, anthropologists.

01:23:01.720 --> 01:23:07.180
They studied—listen to this!—the history of the last 5,000 years on the five continents

01:23:07.180 --> 01:23:12.100
to assess the importance of oceans and navigation in the develoment of the human civilization.

01:23:12.260 --> 01:23:15.040
Glory to the human mind and to our researchers!

01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:16.880
Glory to those who did this work,

01:23:16.940 --> 01:23:23.080
who enable us to make plans for the future and whose inventions improve our lives.

01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:30.480
Everywhere, France must be in the lead of the missions that aim at improving the situation.

01:23:30.700 --> 01:23:39.020
It is our duty to propose a campaign to remediate oceans and remove this abominable mass of plastic

01:23:39.020 --> 01:23:42.380
that proliferates there and that poisons all the living creatures.

01:23:42.500 --> 01:23:44.680
How long are we going to let that happen?

01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:50.700
France must present a cooperation project to all its Mediterranean neighbors and partners

01:23:50.820 --> 01:23:57.100
—all of them, especially those from the little Mediterranean basin that directly concerns us—

01:23:57.360 --> 01:24:04.900
a project for collecting all the wastewater from the shores in order to prevent the Mediterranean

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:08.580
—the mother of all the seas,  the mother of everything, the mother of our civilization—

01:24:08.740 --> 01:24:13.440
from turning into a sewer in less than 50 years!
We must do something!

01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:18.600
Enough with wastewater spills!

01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:27.760
About this issue, I cannot finish without repeating something I already said.

01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:36.040
You have a battle to wage—you and I of course!—a battle against privatization.

01:24:37.060 --> 01:24:42.500
You are not aware of it, but there's an authority that delivers permissions for offshore drilling.

01:24:43.460 --> 01:24:46.440
It is a very repectable international authority.

01:24:47.460 --> 01:24:51.540
It already granted 25 authorizations to do offshore drillings.

01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:54.760
The last country that was authorized to drill was India.

01:24:55.720 --> 01:25:01.200
Sulphur emissions are collected.
They contain more minerals than anything.

01:25:02.060 --> 01:25:07.640
They all started to exploit oceans using the savage methods of capitalism.

01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:11.780
Exploiting! Exploiting! Conquering! Appropriating! Making money!

01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:14.580
With everything we find, everything that moves!

01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:26.200
A international court must be created to register complaints.

01:25:29.180 --> 01:25:33.640
Otherwise, they'll do as they wish,

01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:41.500
and we will depend on an authority that will be invaded by lobbies, as all authorities.

01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:47.860
This court has to be created, and France must be—I said it on many occasions during meetings on this issue—

01:25:48.300 --> 01:25:52.040
in the lead of a mandate under the authority of the UNO.

01:25:52.420 --> 01:25:57.580
The UNO, yes, which is the only institution that represents all humanity.

01:25:57.760 --> 01:26:05.260
It is often mocked and said to be slow, but for now, it is the only institution that all the nations have in common,

01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:12.000
and it is far more legitimate than all the rogue institutions like the G8 or the G20

01:26:12.620 --> 01:26:14.620
that bring the rest of the world to heel.

01:26:18.660 --> 01:26:23.680
There must be an international treaty on deep waters.

01:26:24.140 --> 01:26:29.400
Until now, there has been exclusive economic areas—which means they belong to countries,

01:26:29.900 --> 01:26:33.940
this one, that one, sometimes we don't know, and this could bring about wars.

01:26:34.380 --> 01:26:41.140
You're afraid of ice melts at the poles, but they're already in their boats trying to be the first to appropriate oceans bottoms.

01:26:41.860 --> 01:26:48.660
Such is the situation today. It explains the tensions between Russia, Norway, the USA and many other countries.

01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:51.040
Who owns the bottom of the oceans and the resources they contain?

01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:53.160
Meanwhile, all we do is talk about other issues!

01:26:53.460 --> 01:26:59.560
We don't know that the map of oceans bottom is changing, and that we are a great power,

01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:05.560
not for ourselves—we must be a leading power and speak on behalf of all humanity! This is our strength!

01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:10.920
So what are going to do? There must be an international treaty on deep waters!

01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:14.900
It is called a 'res nullius' territory, it belongs to no one,

01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:18.120
which means that the first country who appropriates it owns it.

01:27:19.260 --> 01:27:26.760
Those who want to dump the waste of their big ocean liner and spill their wastewater

01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:30.860
can do it, because for now, it belongs to no one,

01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:34.000
but tomorrow, it will belong to the first country who appropriates it.

01:27:34.700 --> 01:27:46.660
We must tackle these issues and  questions, because we are skilled and powerful in all these domains.

01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:51.960
There are ten levels of intervention to get to the bottom of oceans!

01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:55.200
Ten levels of human intervention,
ten levels of excellence!

01:27:55.540 --> 01:27:59.760
Well there are French leading companies for each of these ten levels,

01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:03.720
from the bottom—not always for the best, i.e. drilling—to the surface!

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:09.740
We can do this everywhere, consequently, we have a duty: doing it and sharing our techniques!

01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:13.620
We mustn't keep our knowledge for ourselves!

01:28:15.060 --> 01:28:17.060
We must have...

01:28:17.740 --> 01:28:23.900
As I said earlier, we must involve other countries that for now do not have the workers or the capacity

01:28:23.900 --> 01:28:27.700
to take part in this new great feast of humanity.

01:28:27.900 --> 01:28:36.280
We must create an international oceans university open to all the countries that want to join us

01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:41.240
—French-speaking countries in particular—to develop these activities,

01:28:41.340 --> 01:28:44.340
because all the peoples of the world need to have access to oceans,

01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:50.600
because all the peoples of the world need to be aware of this issue in order to feel implicated.

01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:57.780
When we had the idea to do this rally,
we thought "Well..."

01:29:00.100 --> 01:29:09.960
"Space, the digital world, oceans, culture, research...
People might not be interested in these issues..."

01:29:11.060 --> 01:29:13.060
I don't believe a word of it.

01:29:14.440 --> 01:29:16.440
I think you are interested by these issues.

01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:18.440
Audience: Yes!

01:29:24.460 --> 01:29:26.460
That's not all!

01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:34.220
It's like appetizers, although I'm dwelling on the subject a bit.

01:29:35.060 --> 01:29:37.000
But it's a good thing sometimes.

01:29:37.460 --> 01:29:44.700
It's supposed to make you want to read the booklets on the digital world, on culture, on schools.

01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:48.440
Please read them.

01:29:49.260 --> 01:29:54.400
And even if you don't want to vote for this programme, read them anyway,

01:29:54.940 --> 01:29:58.760
because the force of ideas is that they are contagious, as they say.

01:29:59.380 --> 01:30:02.180
I'm a happy man these days, you know?

01:30:02.760 --> 01:30:06.920
Because the space of the ideas we've been fighting for during the last years,

01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:11.460
even though there were moments when we felt lonely, as if no one understood what we were saying,

01:30:11.900 --> 01:30:17.220
well we were heartened to hear other people talking about ecological planning!

01:30:17.740 --> 01:30:21.480
We were heartened to hear the words we use being shared on all sides!

01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:25.920
We thank those who led that struggle before us,
and we thank ourselves for leading this fight.

01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:28.840
It's a good thing that other people take on our ideas!

01:30:30.280 --> 01:30:35.220
I'm not in favor of copyrights!

01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:39.920
You know, the whole point of internet is the hypertext link, it changed everything,

01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:43.840
however the EU said: "Wait! There are copyrights!"

01:30:44.660 --> 01:30:48.800
Well I don't think there should be copyrights! I think there should be a right of quotation on the internet.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:53.180
I mean people should say: "I stole Mélenchon's ideas" sometimes.

01:30:53.960 --> 01:30:55.960
They don't, but it doesn't matter.

01:30:56.980 --> 01:30:59.520
What matters is the spreading of ideas.

01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:07.040
When you share ideas like these, you understand that we cannot live in an absurd, cruel and stupid world,

01:31:07.100 --> 01:31:10.860
in which eight people own as much as 50 % of the world population!

01:31:12.760 --> 01:31:19.560
This is absurd, ridiculous, obscene and immoral!

01:31:20.860 --> 01:31:23.260
Growing rich is immoral!

01:31:24.040 --> 01:31:26.520
This is the morality I'm advocating.

01:31:26.760 --> 01:31:29.980
Of course, we should enjoy life and be rewarded for our efforts,

01:31:30.340 --> 01:31:32.680
but what is the point of accumulating all these fortunes?

01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:37.680
Why should a handful of people own billions?
What for? Does it make them any happier?

01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:40.020
No it doesn't, it just goes into the financial bubble!

01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:53.840
Yesterday, I was in a small village called Champagney, Haute-Saône.

01:31:56.100 --> 01:31:58.400
I felt like going there all of a sudden.

01:32:00.860 --> 01:32:06.440
I felt like going there because February 4th is the anniversary of the abolition of slavery.

01:32:10.300 --> 01:32:14.340
There are still 250 million slaves around the world, you know?

01:32:14.620 --> 01:32:17.780
They're not far sometimes, but we don't see them.

01:32:18.980 --> 01:32:19.980
I was saying that...

01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:27.360
—Of course, slavery should not be compared with other forms of servitude.

01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:32.020
This form of criminality is very specific.
To begin with, it lasted 300 years!

01:32:32.580 --> 01:32:37.640
And when the people of Champagney heard that blacks were enslaved...

01:32:37.640 --> 01:32:39.640
—they didn't believe that they were black to begin with!

01:32:40.100 --> 01:32:47.060
They had to look at a portrait of Balthazar, the Magus, to make sure blacks existed.

01:32:47.460 --> 01:32:50.660
And so they wondered how come human beings could be sold as objects,

01:32:50.660 --> 01:32:55.160
all the more so because one of them honored their Lord when he was born! It didn't make any sense!

01:32:55.160 --> 01:32:57.160
So these good people wrote a letter to the King.

01:32:57.500 --> 01:33:02.300
Can you imagine that the people of Champagney—minors, loggers, peasants—

01:33:02.300 --> 01:33:06.520
worried about people who were suffering on the other side of the world?

01:33:06.620 --> 01:33:10.680
This is what they told the King in their list of grievances: "Enough!"

01:33:11.120 --> 01:33:19.020
It is our duty to disobey the economic realities that are said to prevail over the realities of human beings and of the heart.

01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:20.000
Got it?

01:33:20.420 --> 01:33:23.040
And I'd like to add that...

01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:35.620
As Victor Schoelcher said at the time of the second abolition of slavery...

01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:42.320
He said: "If the only way to make the colonies work is slavery, then we must give up our colonies!"

01:33:43.460 --> 01:33:48.200
And Robespierre before him said: "Death to the colonies if a principle is at stake!"

01:33:48.740 --> 01:33:52.180
You must carry this flame of rebellioussness within yourselves!

01:33:52.580 --> 01:33:58.400
It links you to all the human beings, towards whom each and everyone of you have a responsibility !

01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:00.680
Yes!

01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:06.400
But there's something you need to do before that.

01:34:06.840 --> 01:34:11.260
You mustn't renounce your main prerogative.

01:34:11.780 --> 01:34:13.780
Your right to power.

01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:20.820
You are citizens, and the Declaration of 1789 is called the Declaration of the Rights of Man,

01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:26.780
but it would be nothing without the last phrase: The Declaration of the Right of Man and of the Citizens.

01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:28.660
Of the Citizens!

01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:32.920
You had power, and you must have it back!

01:34:33.700 --> 01:34:43.560
You must do more than kicking them out or voting for the lesser evil, because the lesser evil is still evil!

01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:57.020
For once, you must answer our call and consider your ballot paper an adhesion paper!

01:34:57.340 --> 01:35:00.480
Try not to lose it!

01:35:00.820 --> 01:35:06.340
Don't let yourselves be deceived by a pretendedly antifinance speech again,

01:35:06.500 --> 01:35:10.240
followed by a pretendedly "I will change the European treaties" speech!

01:35:12.740 --> 01:35:16.860
Look closely, study and convince people around you.

01:35:17.060 --> 01:35:22.120
Don't let yourselves be fooled by fine words,
but look what is going to make a great force of us.

01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:27.000
This is why we must vote to abolish the presidential monarchy.

01:35:27.260 --> 01:35:33.580
This is why the core and number one priority of the programme is the establishment of the 6th Republic.

01:35:40.300 --> 01:35:42.300
The 6th Republic!

01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:48.540
Not the 5th Republic, in which the President who,

01:35:48.900 --> 01:35:53.820
following a discussion with the powdered marquesses around him on the occasion,

01:35:54.300 --> 01:35:59.480
says he will organize a referendum to ask you whether you want him to ratify the treaty or not.

01:36:00.060 --> 01:36:04.260
We want a real assembly that regenerates the French people!

01:36:04.260 --> 01:36:09.600
The deputies we'll choose —men and women—will share a common characteristic,

01:36:09.960 --> 01:36:14.140
that of having never been elected in any assembly!

01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:25.040
These deputies—men and women—whether they are elected or chosen by drawing lots,

01:36:25.740 --> 01:36:30.960
by redefining the rights of the French people together,

01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:37.400
will regenerate the legal community and our consent to this community,

01:36:37.580 --> 01:36:44.440
Today, we do not consent to the law, because it often seems to be abusive, and often, it is the case.

01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:50.360
How come was the El Khomri labor law voted when neither the French nor demonstrators on the street

01:36:50.580 --> 01:36:56.360
nor deputies nor anyone wanted it? It was forced into the legislature using Article 49-3 six times!

01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:04.900
Down with the presidential monarchy!

01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:09.880
Don't let the the numerous fabulists who are out there these days deceive you!

01:37:10.100 --> 01:37:16.180
The constitution of the 6th Republic must be written by a constituent assembly

01:37:16.420 --> 01:37:19.820
and ratified by the French people by referendum!

01:37:19.900 --> 01:37:23.820
It must not be a draft written by a handful of people that would be conceded to the people!

01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:36.780
You will introduce the new sacred rights of individual freedom in the constitution,

01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:41.640
but more importantly, you must make sure to keep your power permanently,

01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:48.180
because I will propose the introduction of the recall referendum into the new constitution.

01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:58.100
It enables the people to remove an elected representative from office when it gathered enough signatures.

01:37:58.820 --> 01:38:04.440
I was told that it would be a mess, but what is the current situation if not a mess?

01:38:04.840 --> 01:38:10.980
Is it because it is invisible that they don't call it a mess? Of course it's a mess, the most despicable one!

01:38:11.540 --> 01:38:17.200
We have to obey laws that are unfair and despicable because no one ever voted them,

01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:21.920
because they are decrees of the President-King, who is surrounded day and night by the court of the stock exchange,

01:38:22.040 --> 01:38:26.740
its lobbyists, its subdivisions, its puppets and its storytellers!

01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:32.540
I want my message to be clear as crystal.

01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:39.360
Everytime someone gives us a hand instead of insulting us, we are happy.

01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:47.640
Everytime someone offered to give us a hand and to accompany us for a while, we never said no.

01:38:48.060 --> 01:38:52.620
But we will always refuse schemes and secret arrangements!

01:38:52.980 --> 01:38:58.100
We will never exchange parts of our programme against constituencies,

01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:02.720
or ministerial portfolios against amnesty our amnesia!

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:10.860
This is and will be out of the question!
My candidacy is about being intransigent!

01:39:10.860 --> 01:39:16.320
We are not harsh, we do not turn down offers of help,
we are just demanding!

01:39:16.540 --> 01:39:20.960
There's nothing else I can do because that's the way you are, and I'm your representative.

01:39:21.140 --> 01:39:27.860
I represent hard heads and rebels, people who will not be taken for a fool for a second, a third our a fourth time!

01:39:35.420 --> 01:40:07.700
Audience: Resistance! Resistance! Resistance!

01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:09.940
JLM: Come on, my friends!

01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:19.440
I want to hear the people in Paris too!

01:40:24.140 --> 01:40:26.140
We are in Lyon!

01:40:31.780 --> 01:40:34.180
Lyon used to be a major working-class city!

01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:39.900
While your are shouting "resistance",
let's see if you are as resistant as I am!
