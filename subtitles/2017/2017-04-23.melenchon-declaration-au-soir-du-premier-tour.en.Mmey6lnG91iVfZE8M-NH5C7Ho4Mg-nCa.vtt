00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:08.920
The result announced at the start of this evening isn't the one we were hoping for.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:17.480
In any assumption, the right result isn't going to be the one which was announced.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:26.080
As a matter of fact, the Ministry of the Interior will not disclose its final declaration until midnight.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:37.080
Evidently, mediacrats and oligarchs won't stop gloating until then. They couldn't think of something more beautiful

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:47.140
than a second voting round between two candidates who both embrace and wish to perpetuate

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:54.370
the current institutions, expressing no concern for ecology or the danger

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:01.760
where the human civilization is, and both want to undermine, once again,

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:12.700
the most essential workers' rights in this country. Be that as it may, when the official results are in,

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.680
we will accept them no matter what they are.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:32.340
I can't say or do anything more at this point. Each and every one of you knows fully well

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:45.720
what his or her duty is, and I accept that. I wasn't granted the right to speak

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:57.420
in the names of the 450,000 people who voted for me.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.460
Let them therefore express themselves in the polls

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:16.980
so that their decision can be made public.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:26.580
My beautiful country, my beautiful motherland, as well as all of you, we can be proud

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:40.040
of what we've undertaken and accomplished. We are a conscious and passionate force.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:50.040
I call upon you to stay united, to form an active movement

00:02:50.080 --> 00:03:01.340
for all the challenges we have mentioned, difficult as they may be,

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:10.140
remain to be taken on.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.660
Those who are competing today for the honour to represent us have thoroughly proven

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:22.640
their inability to think said challenges through.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:32.700
The coming hour and the coming days are those of characters and consciousness.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:45.160
You the people, my beloved homeland, are a brand new morning starting to shine through.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:52.850
Remaining true to the motto of the Republic :
Liberty, Equality, Fraternity.

00:03:52.850 --> 00:04:11.330
Long life to the Republic and vive la France.
