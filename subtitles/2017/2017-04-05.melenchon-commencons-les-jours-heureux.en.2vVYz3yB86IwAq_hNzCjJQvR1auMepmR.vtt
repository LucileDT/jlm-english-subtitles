00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.060
I think that, to gather all of us, we need to put an end to the "money-king"

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.960
because it's what divides human beings and ruines nature.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.240
And here is my plan:

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.840
First, change institutions and rethink everything from the very beguinning

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.460
to get a true republic, laic, and really under people's control.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.460
Then, change once and for all to an ecological way to produce and consume.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.780
Afterwards, make finance and CAC40 pay

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.600
the part they owe to raise employment and wages,

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.380
because they have taken enough. Time has come for them to give back.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.480
No more people in the street ! No more misery ! No one in galley !

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.820
Finally, act for peace.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.240
Too little was said about this tonight.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.400
But a war is coming and rising which tends to generalize itself.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.320
Sources of tension are observed all over the world, as well as in the old continent.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.840
Here is "L'avenir en commun" (A future together) that we need to build now.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.000
French ladies and gentlemen,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.660
Republic

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:11.920
in our country

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.180
is more than an institution :

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.740
it's a way of thinking life together.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.740
Liberty, Equality, Fraternity,

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.700
is more than a motto. It's a roadmap.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.240
So, of course, now we need a new president,

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.220
I know it.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.660
And changing our government,

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:32.580
such is my proposition.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.060
But first, I believe that it is about

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.100
beginning happy days

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.340
because our country has suffered long enough,

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.700
and time has come for it, to get back the taste of happiness.
