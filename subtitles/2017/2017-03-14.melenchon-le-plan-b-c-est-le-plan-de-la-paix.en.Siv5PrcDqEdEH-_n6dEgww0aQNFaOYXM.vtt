00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.380
My dear Friends and comrades

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.440
I thank first our Italian hosts

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.600
not just because they organized this new session of the forum for the plan B

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.080
but perhaps more for having provoked

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.440
the spectacular failure of Matteo Renzi

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.540
and to prepare the next one

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.080
for the next referendum that will be organised shortly on the base of

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.320
of the the claims of the central labour body

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.720
I thank the particpants I kindly asked you to excuse

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.060
the disorder created by the French Presidential Election compaign

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.780
in the way our work is progressing

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.080
You may know or to be fair, you might not know

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.360
our meeting is part of the French Presidential Election Campaign. Why?

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.340
Because, at the time we are speaking now 50% of the electorate in France

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.700
which is something we never seen before

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.680
do not know either if they will go and vote

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.420
and if so, whom they will vote for

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.740
So we have a very volatile situation

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.640
in which each political act counts in the way the judgement

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.800
of the citizen will form

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:25.040
I thank especially the French media that made the trip to assist our meeting

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.960
to speak about it.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.220
We have decided to have our meeting

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.800
here in Rome this meeting here in Rome because it is a symbolic place

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.200
at the time of the 60th birthday of the signature of the treaty.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.040
For my part, I went to fill myself with energy this morning

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.720
by going on the ancient Roman Forum,

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.880
next to the rostra, the tribunes of the people

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.920
and the first political strike in history, (the Secessio plebis ) when the people, in 494bc

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.900
when the pleb simply abandoned the city en masse to go to the Auentinus Mons,

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:05.220
and leaving the patrician order to themselves to force them to realize that without the plebs, they were nothing

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.760
And now here I am among you.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.940
When the Treaty of Rome was proposed

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:18.180
Already many voices, and among the most eminent in France, pointed out

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.600
That it had a content that would lead to damages.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.540
This content is the central idea that the market

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.040
Must be the regulator of human activities.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.540
If the market becomes the regulator of human affairs,

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.520
Then there is no longer any general human interest, there is only the law of the exchange of goods

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.300
And the law of the exchange of goods implies

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:49.080
That they always cost less, that is to say that the workers and the employees are always more exploited

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.260
And nature more and more destroyed.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.740
Basically, this long history of the construction of the European Union as it results

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.720
Of the Treaty of Rome has experienced ups and downs.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.860
It can not be said that there were no magnificent opportunities present

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.640
In the course of this story

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.900
they have been missed, especially when the socio-democratic governments

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.900
Were mostly in Europe before collapsing miserably

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:26.440
In a generalized system of large coalitions between the socio-democratic parties and the right, making the confession

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.580
Because there is no difference in their vision of the future

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.520
And in this way, this system of grand coalition

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:41.620
Has resulted in a political paralysis such that the extreme right everywhere has gained a foothold

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.380
And know the developments we are experiencing

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.720
And which are a threat to democracy in each of our countries.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.880
Europe entered the end of the cycle,

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:59.780
But the European idea does not belong to the European Union,

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.740
It belongs to the people who first formulated it in the past in hope

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.440
Always renewed

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.980
The fact that by cooperating ever more closely

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.640
There would be a process of social harmonization from the top,

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:19.960
By cooperating more and more closely, they would repel the threat of war.

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.260
But what we have before us is exactly the opposite

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.080
And we do not need to invoke ideological reasons

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:32.060
To speak about the end of the European Union, it is enough to see the facts,

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.840
This end is begun. The Brexit is the signal [video break]

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.820
But the signature of CETA

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.380
Is a second signal

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.400
Extremely violent because what is CETA?

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.340
In itself, a violation of democracy.

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:54.900
This treaty, with free trade with Canada, will apply even before any parliament

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:00.560
Representative of the people expressed themselves on the subject

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.320
And second, it creates a set of standards

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.860
Social, environmental

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.840
Which will impose itself on all future developments of the Union, in other words

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.300
The European Union, whatever she says, whatever she wants,

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.580
Will never go further than what is in CETA

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.480
Because in international law, a treaty

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.920
Has a value superior to the national law consequently

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.840
The CETA has a legal value superior to everything that the European Union

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.620
Could decide on the standards that are established by CETA

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.340
So CETA is somehow the signal of the end of a part

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.640
Of the evolvement project of the European Union.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:48.880
And finally there was in this context, after the Brexit, after the CETA,

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.060
After all this violence against Cyprus or against Greece,

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:58.820
Where a revolver was put on the peoples' temples by depriving them of the monetary circulation

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.460
To oblige them to capitulate,

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.640
There is this summit that you saw at Versailles, which has aggravated everything,

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:10.220
Because all of a sudden, the Europe of 28

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.620
Has seen 4 countries

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.840
Deciding for all the others.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:21.580
And again when you say 4, you get the impression that there are two that hide behind the other two,

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.560
And when you say two, you get the impression that there just one

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.040
Who was hiding behind the other three.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:33.520
So much, that this Show aggravated the divisions in Europe, provoked

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.680
Legitimate protests by those who feel equal in law

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.320
And which were removed from the summit of Versailles.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:46.240
All this came over a rickety and half-collapsed building,

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:51.120
The mad logic of European budgetary treaties:

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:56.400
Prohibition of social harmonization, prohibition of fiscal harmonization

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:01.060
Had the main result of throwing the nations one against the other

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:04.880
In competition while pretending to build a union.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.540
We have all become competitors

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:11.880
In a competition cynically organized, according to the confession of M. Barroso,

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.500
For each country to pay

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.700
Its structural adjustment on the backs of others,

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:22.220
And as it is significant to see that at the competition

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:26.500
Social dumping, tax dumping,

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.260
Has given himself as President M.Junker,

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.820
That one can consider as the first cheater of Europe

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:37.000
Since it was under his authority that Luxembourg Has given itself the right

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.940
To create tax favors that have been a real hold-up on everything else

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:45.200
Of public treasures in Europe.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.960
It is in this context that the logic of a grand coalition

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:54.240
The Social Democratic parties, which are often the first party

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:58.260
Coming from this long and old history of social progress

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:04.840
Allied with the right, absolutely strangled any possibility of expression outside its ranks.

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:08.980
The result, as we have it before us, everywhere

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:12.200
The narrowest and most limited nationalism,

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:18.200
Everywhere movements that are a incredible political regression, intellectual and democratic

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.520
It is against this slope that we are heading

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.600
And here are the 4 important

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:27.200
Have decided to embark on a leak forward

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:30.440
where the Juncker plan

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:33.340
Is the framework, maybe you know,

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:35.980
But maybe you are like us in France.

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:38.740
We in France we never know anything,

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:42.760
Some MEPs try to say, to inform

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.060
But the great number knows nothing,

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:48.840
It has not been told that Mr.Junker has proposed 4 plans

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.200
To redevelop Europe:

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.900
Firstly, we continue as before,

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:57.340
He was obliged to say that, he could not say that before it was less than bad,

00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:01.200
He could not say if we were forced to think about a new plan it is because the previous one

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.160
Has failed miserably.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:07.880
Second plan: we will only do the single market,

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:10.280
What a beautiful European ideal!

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:13.560
But they themselves are alarmed by saying if we only do the single market

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:18.960
We will be forced to go overboard two-thirds of the decisions we have already made in the past.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:22.580
And even Mr.Junker comes to say

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:29.300
"If we only do the single market there will be an environmental hazard".

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:33.340
Third plan: we will do less but better, the famous formula of Lenin,

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:36.880
Applied to M. Junker, is rather funny,

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:42.780
Because if you can do better by doing less, let's do it, why didn't we do it?

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:46.780
And finally, the last plan is this multi-speed Europe

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:50.960
Which is sold everywhere as a novelty,

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:55.400
Something that has just been discovered,

00:09:55.400 --> 00:10:01.140
But which is an old age that we French know as it was proposed more than 10 years ago and that anyway,

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:03.480
it's already the reality.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:06.160
There is a multi-speed Europe.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:10.560
The euro accounts for only 19 out of 28 countries.

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:14.060
The Schengen agreement does not include all the countries of the European Union,

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:19.560
 

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.060
And I add that on the military plan, which has become the great new European idea,

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:25.720
There is a neutral country, Austria, which will never participate in any military coalition.

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:33.560
So that Europe with several speeds is a presentation in a new packaging of what?

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:37.400
The fact that the reactionary heart of Europe

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.440
Represented by Mrs Merkel's Government

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:44.320
Wants to give itself new means of coercion,

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:48.220
System around a central core

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:50.980
Who will continue to defend fiercly

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:55.800
The transnational capital strategy embodied in

00:10:55.800 --> 00:11:00.820
The budgetary treaty and the European Mechanismof Financial Stability .

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:06.140
Their multi-speed Europe is just a strategy to maintain a rickety building

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:10.020
Which everywhere receives the blows of peoples, it is only that.

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:14.980
That not one of you has any doubt about their intentions

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:18.000
And I hope the French will understand it quickly.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.020
It is interesting, since I speak to you as a French

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:27.760
To see how the social democracy which has succeeded in this round of power

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:31.820
To invest in some way two candidates

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:37.020
On the European level. One is Mr. Macron, who copies

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:41.540
almost word per word the directives of the European Commission.

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:46.420
I know it may seem incredible to you but we who knows the texts

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:52.440
Nous avons retrouvé tel quel les réclamations de la commission européenne contre la France

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:56.480
Comme programme présidentiel d'un des candidats.

00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:02.240
If anyone ever deserves to be called "the commission's candidate" it is him

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:05.940
And the other candidate of the Social Democracy proposes

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:11.820
The constitution of a parliament of the euro area and of a eurozone economic government,

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:18.220
Adding that as soon as 50% of the peoples of the nations would agree, it would apply.

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:25.420
They do not tell us what they will do to those who are not in the Eurozone but who are reputed to be just as European as the others,

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:31.400
Nor of what will do this second parliament and this sixth president of the parliament

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:34.700
In the midst of all this mob

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:42.360
Presidents, assemblies, councils which, at bottom, do not change anything, since they themselves have said

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:47.620
That their Assembly and Government would not repeal the treaties but would complete them.

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:52.420
How can we complement a treaty that bans social harmonization

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:55.140
pretend to do social harmonization?

00:12:55.140 --> 00:13:01.760
How can we supplement a treaty that forbids tax harmonization by proposing tax harmonization?

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:06.120
All this is incoherent! But this inconsistency is a distress signal

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:09.660
And I would like to repeat the expression of the beginning of my speech:

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:17.180
The European idea, the peaceful idea and social progress does not belong to the European Union and its current leaders,

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:24.680
Who are incapable of managing this idea, and who have led it to the catastrophe towards which we are heading. Double catastrophe.

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:29.600
Social catastrophe and disaster in the field of peace.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:33.760
It is on this question that I come to my conclusion.

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:37.520
Plan A is in our mind,

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:41.540
Whatever the diversity of our situations in each of our countries,

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:45.180
Diversity that is of extreme importance,

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:49.360
since national elections do not take place all the same day throughout Europe,

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:55.740
It is impossible to have a progressive European strategy other than in the framework of the national struggle

00:13:55.740 --> 00:14:01.160
And therefore of the capacity we have to mobilize our entire people

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:04.580
Towards a political objective.

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:09.380
The Revolutionary Strategy of the Citizen Revolution relies

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:14.300
On the democratic will of each of our peoples, and necessarily one after the other.

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:18.740
This is why we have discussed the idea of plan B

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:22.840
And we called our forum the "Plan B forum" exactly like others

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:30.200
Had called their forum in Latin America the "forum of San Paolo", even if they met only once in San Paolo,

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:33.800
An assembly which at first made the important and the powerful smile,

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:39.980
But an assembly in which 11 governments have since been recruited. I form the wish that we find in this room

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:43.060
The next 11 governments of the European Union.

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:47.680
But be assured that we are at least working to guarantee the next "our home".

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:52.000
Plan A is basically what we have in common,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:59.820
We no longer want to continue a Europe where social harmonization is forbidden,

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:03.660
This is why our first common demand for Plan A

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:08.420
Is social harmonization from the top, because there is social harmonization

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:11.080
Which is being done from the bottom.

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:15.800
We do not want a Europe where there is no tax harmonization

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:20.800
Because that is what allows companies to move their

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:25.320
The taxation will be the lowest, that is, the contribution to the common good.

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:29.060
And so we want tax harmonization to be possible.

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:36.340
These two points oblige us to say that we must break with the present treaties because these two points are in the present treaties,

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:38.760
It is not a purely ideological matter

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:41.480
Although one has the right to have ideological visions)

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:47.380
But it is a practical and practical matter. We want to get out of treaties that take two absurd dispositions

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:50.120
That ruin and kill the Europe as an idea

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.520
At the very heart of its setting in motion

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:54.880
And what is Plan B?

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:59.160
What is plan B? In spite of all our differences on the question?

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:02.280
Plan B is first and foremost the fruit of history.

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:07.120
In this rostrum there is Zoé, who was the President of the Greek Parliament

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:12.560
And who maintained her loyalty to the engagement of a fight on which she had been elected.

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.620
What happened ?

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:18.120
Isolated Greece faced

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:22.160
Other countries and in particular unbearable arrogance

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:26.580
The government of Mrs Merkel, her violence, her brutality

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:31.800
Through the unacceptable statements of M.Schäuble

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:41.020
Greece because it was isolated, because we were not able to organize together the movement that would have helped to support it,

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:44.540
Was put in the situation where its leaders thought

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:47.960
That by doing good manners they would obtain good results.

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:51.700
The discussion has ended on this subject, and what are the results: none.

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:56.580
Therefore the method was worth nothing, the only one that is worth something is to have a plan B.

00:16:56.580 --> 00:17:00.940
If they do not give up for a  Plan A then we will move to Plan B. What is Plan B?

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:02.440
What is Plan B?

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:08.160
Plan B is the plan that I have just presented as plan A, if the others do not want it then we do it anyway

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.940
Between those who agree.

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:13.580
Therefore Plan B is an internationalist plan.

00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:17.120
It is not a nationalist plan where everyone goes home

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:19.920
And manages with its national situation,

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:24.200
It's an internationalist plan and that's where we play a part we in this room,

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:26.920
Such as we are.

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:30.420
We play a role because we are prefiguring this plan B.

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:35.560
People who want to know what Plan B is, what's the internationalism of the Plan B  they just have to come to you,

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:39.180
You each in your country, or you on these benches.

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:42.760
Plan B is Plan A maintained

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.700
As we imagine it, as we want it,

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:48.660
Not ideology, but because it corresponds to the interests

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:52.540
Of our peoples, and this places us in the perspective that is ours

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:55.300
That's with what I want to finish.

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:59.600
We made Europe for social welfare, we thought, we believed it,

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:01.680
Our people believe it,

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:07.860
And this formidable adhesion which is preserved in our peoples for the European idea has deep roots

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:10.960
Which is not as we said fear. No,

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:13.320
Our peoples are committed to peace,

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:15.860
Our peoples are more reasonable than the rulers,

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:19.600
They know that Europe is the womb of all wars.

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:23.800
They know that all the world wars were born in Europe

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:26.740
And that the scars on our borders

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:30.480
Are still fresh in many places

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:34.700
And that  a false movement wil be enough to reopen them.

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:37.840
Our people know that peace

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:42.900
Is a construction that requires vigilance, in application

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:46.920
And not the stupid casualness we see in power today.

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:50.400
Yes peace is threatened in Europe,

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:54.300
It is threatened because the USA

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:56.980
Play an extremely disturbing game

00:18:56.980 --> 00:19:00.820
Which it is no longer clear whether its main objective is to divide

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:05.280
Europeans or to confront Russia

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:07.900
Designated as an adversary.

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:11.060
We know that we do not want war in Europe.

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:13.360
We want peace, and for that

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:18.980
We can not accept that a country is designated as an adversary by nature.

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:21.840
For us French, in our deep history,

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:25.620
Whatever the regime in place in Russia,

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:29.780
That it was that of the Tsar under the Third Republic (ours)

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:35.240
Or that it was that of Stalin in the time of General de Gaulle,

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:40.420
France had always  Russia as a partner

00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:44.540
It is geography and history that dictate this obligation, and consequently

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:49.140
We must not accept going to war as we are doing.

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:53.020
Sweden reinstated compulsory military service

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:59.780
batteries of missiles anti-missiles have been installed in Poland, which are now being met by missile batteries on the Russian side.

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:02.980
Climbing has begun, it's our role

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:04.700
To do everything to prevent it.

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:08.920
There must therefore be a conference on security and peace in Europe

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:14.820
Because the collapse of the Soviet empire was not discussed anywhere, it was abandoned to the law of the strongest.

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:16.760
And during all these years,

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:21.860
NATO leaders have never stopped lying to their Russian partner, it should not be surprising

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:25.480
That afterwards they too began to make demonstrations of strength.

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:28.900
Plan B is more than ever the plan of peace

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:31.280
Against the temptations of war.

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:35.640
It's a pitty that the President of the French Republic, Mr Francois Hollande, said

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:39.200
That Europe could revive

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.400
As a Europe of defense.

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:44.340
Europe of defense? against who ?

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:47.500
To do what ? Which Europe of defense?

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:52.640
It does not exist ! Europe of defense is the Europe of war.

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:57.680
And we want to build a Europe of peace. It is on these words that I shall finish. My friends,

00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:01.960
I know that when the time comes,

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:05.000
If the ballot boxes are favorable,

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.900
To us in France in this situation so changing, so volatile

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:16.360
When the time comes you will come to the rescue,

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:21.080
Because none of us can think tomorrow

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:23.780
To govern any state

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:25.360
Without the support of others.

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:28.700
But the support of others is primarily the support of the people,

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:33.700
It is the people who count, they must be the sovereign.

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:37.040
And so powerful that France is, and it is,

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:40.280
It is nothing if the other peoples

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:42.360
Do not recognize in the word that it bears

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:45.460
Something that concerns them very directly.

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:49.320
France, governed by us, would be France of Plan B,

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:52.080
It would be yours, it is universal France. Thank you.
