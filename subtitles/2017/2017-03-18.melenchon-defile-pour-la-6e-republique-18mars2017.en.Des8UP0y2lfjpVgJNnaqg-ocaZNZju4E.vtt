00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:14.340
Crowd: Resistance! Resistance! Resistance!

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.400
Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon: I knew you'd come.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.380
I knew the wave that carries us is inexhaustible.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.500
Generation after generation, it carried us from Bastille square to Republic square.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:00.200
Listen! Listen to this clamor that bursts from our ranks!

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:11.140
This sound has no name, as the sound of wind in the leaves, as the sound of rain on the cobblestones.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:23.340
This sound has no name but it is a signal: the signal of the people's strength when it emerges in its own history.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.600
This roar that passes by upon our lines,

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.060
it is the roar of the bronze lion tat sits at the base of the monument

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.960
whose sculptor wished it to be a symbol of universal suffrage,

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.580
the suffrage that is about to speak and decide our fate.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.560
Our voices are rising towards this woman, Marianne, the Republic,

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:07.780
this Republic that is unfinished as long as  the people is not the sovereign in its country in each and every aspect of its life.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.800
Look at her.

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:21.080
She proudly wears the hat of emancipated slaves,

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:27.880
the hat of recovered freedom, the hat of  broken servitude.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:35.940
It is our turn to wear this hat of unsubduedness that we take up.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:44.020
Once more, we walked from Bastille square to Republic square.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:51.700
Bastille square is the place where every momentum of freedom of the French people begins,

00:03:52.420 --> 00:04:01.780
because it is the place where the symbol of monarchy and of the privileged caste was destroyed for the first time.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.180
because it is the place where the last throne of the kings was detroyed,

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:15.920
because it is the place where the first feminist demonstration that demanded the right to vote for women occurred.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:34.820
Five years ago, it is the place where we undertook what we carry on today, steadfastly and coherently,

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.980
full of self-confidence, patiently, until victory!

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:53.760
Upon us, the shades of the wretched faces of humiliated humanity also pass,

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:02.580
those who drowned in the Mediterranean, those who committed suicide at work, those who died abandonned on the street,

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:11.240
all those who suffer from this sickening world in which some accumulate wealth on the endless distress of others.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.200
We are the revenge of the latters.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:26.080
We are the smile they had, we are their intact dignity,

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.380
and the luminous hope of upcoming better days.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:36.380
Rich and powerful of the Earth, here we are!

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.360
Once again, we are here, facing our history,

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:52.680
on the anniversary of the beginning of the glorious Paris Commune that invented the Social Republic.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:10.760
Corwd: Resistance! Resistance! Resistance!

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:22.300
JLM: On this square, in front of the monument that was built for the centenary of the 1789 revolution

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.400
that made us a united and indivisible people,

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:32.460
not because of our ancestors, of our skin color or even of our language,

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:39.560
but because of the horizon that will always bring us together: Liberty, Equality, Fraternity!

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:51.160
All we want is this lie and this hypocrisy to cease,

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:59.980
that consist in inscribing this motto on every pediment in France and doing the exact opposite!

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:09.100
Here we are, we propose to establish the 6th Republic

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:16.460
on this square that saw the establishment of the 5th Republic that we want to abolish.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:33.300
On this square, the people of Paris gathered after the terrorist attack and the crimes that aimed at terrorizing and dividing it, but in vain!

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.900
The strength of the people maintained its unity.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.300
The strength of the people who gathered overcame everything.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:53.660
On this square, people gathered after each demonstration against the El Khomri Labor law,

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:02.840
forming the "Nuit Debout" assemblies,

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:17.140
that day after day, dreaming, drew the outlines of a new world

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:24.920
in which such laws would cease to exist because our lives are more precious.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:36.160
Once again, from Bastille square to Republic square, a common thread binds the boulevards together.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:46.560
It is the thread of our struggles and of our commitments, of our flags that we always hold high.

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:59.340
Once again, we proclaim that without us, nothing makes sense in France!

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:09.280
Here we are, not for ourselves nor for this moment,

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:18.160
but out of virtue, for you, our people, and out of love, for you, our France!

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:32.420
People of France, and you, the world that so often looks at us, amazed,

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:40.760
here we are, we the citizens' revolution that always starts over,

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:49.420
as this people's passion for the universal rights of human beings, and for the citizens that they want to be.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:54.020
These rights that this people was the first to proclaim,

00:09:54.440 --> 00:10:02.540
that are illustrated in this Declaration that the bronze Marianne is holding before you.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.260
So many people came today

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.660
Sometimes from so far away

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:16.560
Oh!
We needed to feel our strength.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.380
It is our liberty,

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:24.680
It is the fire that burns inside us and will never extinguish,

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:31.760
It is the resort that France, and its hard-working people have in all circumstances.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.400
From this rise en masse,

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.880
I take the part of sympathy

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.840
and of personal support

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
that it obviously includes.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:51.020
But everyone must not lose sight of the fact

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.620
that we are not here for a figure, but for a platform.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:07.660
That this is not only

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:14.640
an extraordinary event during an election campaign

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:17.420
as we never saw before,

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:22.640
This is a political manifestation,

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:25.820
a civic rebellion,

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:29.360
Against the presidential monarchy.

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:51.020
Crowd: Resistance! Resistance!

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:54.080
We came here from everywhere

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.800
to offer our people

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:02.760
to put an end to presidential monarchy

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:05.740
and to its intimate collusion

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:10.120
with the powers of money that subjugate and dominate it.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.100
All the circumstances

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:21.580
invite us for the fervour we express.

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.440
If so much people gathered today, it's because they know.

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:29.840
It's because they know how serious is the situation of their country.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:34.880
Between extreme right-wing that desires an ethnic nation

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:41.320
And the servants of the King Money

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:47.660
That endlessly want to destroy the State and public services.

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:52.940
The country, without us,

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:55.620
would threaten to fall out.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.880
From this square,

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:04.680
We want to propose a positive way out

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.680
that our ballot paper represents.

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:11.020
A way out from the impasse

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:18.420
where dizzy leaders imprisoned us for at least ten years

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.480
that have no other vision of the world

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:25.820
than this rough dogma

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:30.540
according to which markets and finance

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:36.500
would be in the final analysis the final legitimate control

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.500
of human civilisation,

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:41.600
When we say

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.340
"It is fraternity,

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:46.660
"It is love,

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:48.500
"It is care for others

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:51.260
"which is the reason of being of society."

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:02.400
It is in the name of this dogma,

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:13.180
and of their personal inability to stand up to anything,

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:19.860
and to do anything else than always concede to those that seems stronger.

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.720
It is in the name of this

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:28.800
that they commited the worse treachery in democracy:

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:32.060
the betrayal of the vote of people,

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:34.760
the denial of its will,

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.780
the reversal of its decision.

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:41.920
In 2005 and in 2012,

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:44.700
against the vote of French people,

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:49.400
against their clearly expressed will,

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:53.600
Mr. Sarkozy and Mr. Hollande,

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:57.880
successive presidents of the fifth Republic,

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:07.460
gave,

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:10.080
without any legitimacy,

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:12.960
the consent of the country

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:16.680
for an organisation of the European Union

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:19.960
that takes popular sovereignty away

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:23.120
and submit the people to the sovereignty of money.

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:31.800
In this construction,

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:35.340
all powers were handed over

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:40.700
to a completely independent Central Bank

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:45.340
whose only purpose is to protect rent.

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:52.920
This construction forbids social harmonisation,

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:56.320
and fiscal harmonisation between countries.

00:15:56.900 --> 00:16:02.800
That way, it organises an endless competition

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:07.020
between population and inside nations,

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:12.480
So that everywhere are incited

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.020
the blindest nationalisms

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:20.240
and the most absurd xenophobias.

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:29.660
The failure of this construction breaks in front of the present.

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:37.480
The profound ambition of people all around Europe to peace,

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:40.520
system of goodwill,

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:43.200
and to social progress,

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:45.980
system of care for others.

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:50.820
These feeling are completely perverted ever since.

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:58.160
As a consequence, everything must be disobeyed and discussed again.

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:08.000
Finally,

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:12.620
it is to the people, and only the people, once again,

00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:15.080
when the time comes,

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:23.060
that will be asked by a referendary popular consultation

00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:30.820
what it wants to do concerning what I will have negotiated in its name.

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:35.260
An for the future, whatever happens,

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:40.920
ALL the treaties that, one way or the other,

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:46.200
aim to hand down some part of popular sovereignty,

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.920
as it is sometimes necessary,

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:57.640
All these treaties will be automatically submitted to popular referendary approval.

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.600
Already,

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:13.320
the word of France having been commited without thought,

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:21.180
I say that if you elect me I will not sign the CETA.

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:44.960
Crowd: Resistance! Resistance!

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:51.020
Neither the free trade agreement with Canada,

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:53.200
and the Canadian people our friend,

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:57.900
nor any other free trade agreement with anyone

00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:00.640
because it only leads to destroy everything.

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.680
And every time

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:15.920
that we would have to give up our social or environmental standards,

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:20.000
I swear an oath: the answer will be no.

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:30.300
If that much ravaging decisions

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:36.520
could be taken without us ever having our say,

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:46.100
It is because the constitution of the fifth republic provided the means to.

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:51.960
Let's take things into consideration, time having passed.

00:19:53.200 --> 00:20:00.460
This constitution was tailored for an exceptional man

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:03.800
under exceptional circumstances

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:08.600
to face an exceptional situation.

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:12.300
This time is over.

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:20.100
But there is a text left

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:25.120
that must not be in the hands of certain people,

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:30.420
Because it offers to presidential monarchy

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:34.960
incredible means of absolute power.

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:42.200
One after the other, these powers were used.

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:48.660
Who here could forget how,

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:52.700
against the opinion of the mobilised people,

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:56.680
and against the opinion of the tied up Parliament,

00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:04.740
the fire of the article 49-3 of the constitution was triggered

00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:14.300
Six times!

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:18.620
Three times to impose the "Macron law",

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:23.060
three times to impose the "El Khomri law".

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:33.860
It is by this mean of incredible violence in a great democracy

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:37.700
that was inverted from top to bottom

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:41.780
all the social public order of our republic.

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:57.140
Crowd: Resistance! Resistance!

00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:01.600
I deduce that if I am elected,

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:08.860
it will of course be immediately necessary to abrogate the "Macron law",

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:11.160
abrogate the "El Khomri law".

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:17.160
The new constitution

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:26.780
should make the fondamental basis of republican social public order untouchable.

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:34.020
It orders

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:41.820
that the law wanted by the people be placed at the top of the norms hierachy,

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:50.100
and that other agreements from fields or companies can only improve the law.

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:57.200
We must no longer accept

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.680
that it is possible to enact

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:07.180
a labour code per company under the threat of unemployment.

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:13.200
No more that we would imagine

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:16.920
a Highway Code per street

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:18.920
edited by road hogs.

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:29.900
The new constitution

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:32.900
must first be social.

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:36.820
It must allow

00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:43.640
to respond to the devastating effects of relocation policies,

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.720
that one out of two,

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:49.820
given that all compete with everyone,

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:54.880
happens inside the European Union that was supposed to protect us.

00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:58.260
And against pillaging,

00:23:58.260 --> 00:23:59.860
vandalising,

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:02.040
of companies.

00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:08.000
We have to supervise

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:15.400
the currently absolute liberty of shareholders

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:20.820
- whether they are people or financial funds -

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:25.920
that are just as many parasites and leeches installed on the productive corps.

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:33.180
That's why

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:37.780
workers must get constitutional rights

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:43.620
that make them citizens in the company

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:49.480
since the Republic, which defeated Monarchs in the city, left them here of course.

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:56.040
They must have the right of reproach,

00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:58.320
and of disapproval,

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:06.100
against the decisions that put in jeopardy the longevity of the production tool.

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:12.120
They must have the pre-emptive right in cooperative

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:13.480
That is to say

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:20.960
the right to become fully and legitimately the owners of the work tools

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:24.040
when those that own them intend to sell them.

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:41.940
I began my demonstration of the great change that it is necessary to undertake in our democracy by these social questions.

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:47.820
Yes, I wanted to immediately sweep away the idea

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:54.640
that making a constitution would be, in the end, taking care of abstract things

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:59.660
that would only affect the organisation of public authorities.

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:05.560
No, writing a constitution

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:11.180
is writing the kind of society we want to live in,

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:17.120
By stating what are the rights that we admit to one another,

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:21.180
and to each other with the nature.

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:34.680
Our project is one of a kindly society, pleasant for its members.

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:39.120
A peaceful and democratic society,

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:43.560
concerned with the dignity of each person,

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.800
and with how to provide it.

00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:52.020
A society that wants to live in harmony with its members,

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:58.400
that does not accept misery and poverty in the middle of opulence.

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:07.600
A society

00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:14.960
that finally finds the way to its harmony

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:21.560
with the natural ecosystem, our common homeland to us all, human beings.

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:30.980
By calling in an assembly

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:35.060
to write this constitution

00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:39.480
we use a method that, de facto,

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:44.100
puts an end to the reign of providential men and women,

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:47.160
of all kinds of experts committees

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:52.000
that endlessly substitute for community intelligence

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.400
that all the people forms.

00:27:56.280 --> 00:28:00.780
It cannot be in question,

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:06.080
just as it was done in 1958,

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:12.800
that a small group of friends write a text that suits the leaders

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:18.720
and then put it to the vote of people as a personal plebiscite.

00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:25.220
Under these circumstances,

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:28.840
an Assembly must be constituent.

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:36.380
It has to take the time to do its work

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:39.120
while listening to its members

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:44.560
and while listening a lot to the country itself, in particular.

00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:48.160
There is an urgency.

00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:56.160
The current presidential monarchy must be urgently abolished.

00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:58.020
Listen to me:

00:28:58.020 --> 00:28:59.520
I sound the alarm.

00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:09.700
Nowadays, do we correctly measure the dangers that this text enables,

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:15.320
if its use was in the hands of some sorcerer's apprentice?

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:21.040
The article 16 of the current constitution

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:28.840
gives special abolute powers to the President of the Republic

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:30.840
without control

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:32.840
during 30 days.

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:37.740
The article 35

00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:41.300
gives the possiblity to the government

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:44.340
to send troops abroad

00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:47.740
without the vote of the Parliament, during four months.

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:53.800
The article 36

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:56.600
enables the council of ministers

00:29:56.600 --> 00:30:01.040
to decree the state of siege for 12 days

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:03.820
and to transfer the power to the militaries.

00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:11.320
We boo the transfer, not the millitaries.

00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:14.400
The militaries,

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:16.880
they serve and obey,

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:18.520
like it is their duty,

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:19.800
for the homeland.

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:22.140
The article 13

00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:24.020
gives the president

00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:28.600
the right to name the holders of the highest civil and military functions.

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:31.940
I stop there a list I could extend.

00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:36.700
Many of these measures have already been applied.

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:40.040
But I alert:

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:45.080
They could be used once again

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:47.540
under different circumstances

00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:49.740
and for different objectives.

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:53.460
Women and men of France,

00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:55.240
do not entrust,

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:58.220
be it temporary,

00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:00.140
such powers

00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:05.800
to people determined to use them as they already herald,

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:09.520
while they bow to ethnicity or to money.

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:18.720
In the current atmosphere in Europe,

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:23.340
and in the current atmosphere of France,

00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:25.600
is it reasonable

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:28.500
that such a personal power

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:31.380
be this way placed out of reach?

00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:35.000
People gathered here

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.200
propose to France

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:38.480
to put an end to it.

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:47.280
On the contrary, I propose to keep under all circumstances

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:52.040
a capacity

00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:56.940
of direct intervention

00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:58.940
from the people,

00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:00.940
so that...

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:05.900
[Sheets flying in the wind] Thank you. Thank you.

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:12.680
I propose to keep under all circumstances a capacity of direct intervention from the people,

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:15.600
So that at any moment,

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:22.640
and as long as certain conditions - still to be fixed - are fulfilled,

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:26.040
such as the number of petitioners,

00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:31.800
a referendum can be organised

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:36.120
that enables the end of the mandate

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:38.800
of any elected representative

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:43.400
from the mayor, departmental councillor,

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:47.960
to, of course, the President of the Republic as well.

00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:58.200
For us,

00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:01.180
that are the witnesses

00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:04.600
and the voice

00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:07.980
of the power of the people

00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:11.780
here is our maxim:

00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:14.600
whatever the problem is,

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:17.120
the solution is the people.

00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:30.480
We rightly observe

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:33.840
that since 1958,

00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:37.220
this people that was then rural,

00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:40.460
became massively urban.

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:43.780
We observe

00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:47.480
that it mixed up over and over again

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:49.120
by successive waves.

00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:53.100
And we are from those

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:55.820
that are delighted with the part of joy

00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:58.920
that all of this brings in our collective life.

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:08.420
But after so much cupidity,

00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:12.360
so much absurd elation,

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:16.760
of the power of richness

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:19.560
that only concentrates

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:21.420
at the cost of others' poverty...

00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:22.840
Anyway!

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:27.240
Our people has been divided,

00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:31.540
our people has been scattered,

00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:36.840
our people has been split by those precarious status,

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:40.680
back and forth between massive unemployment

00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:43.040
and temporary activity.

00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:45.780
And all of this made an impact

00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:49.380
All of this made many times lose sight

00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:51.380
of what was yet common to us.

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:53.940
Writing

00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:55.740
a constitution

00:34:55.740 --> 00:34:57.740
all together,

00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:00.660
it is first decreeing that we,

00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:02.860
whoever we are, are equal in rights.

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:05.340
And that it is together,

00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:08.340
that we mutually admit our rights.

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:10.900
In this way,

00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:13.880
by writing the constitution,

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:16.900
it is the people that refounds itself

00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:19.740
and mixes up itself in a whole

00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:24.200
to become the one and indivisible republic again.

00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:44.460
Crowd: Resistance! Resistance!

00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:47.180
So that it may be so,

00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:50.340
and so that we decide

00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:51.980
each one

00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:57.620
from her perspective, with her history, and her own trajectory;

00:35:57.620 --> 00:36:01.280
So that every one of us can freely contribute

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:05.000
to the collecitve reflection,

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.260
above all,

00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:15.540
the absolute freedom of conscience of the human beings, that we are, must be protected

00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:24.340
Of course,

00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:26.400
it is the matter of secularity.

00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:33.340
State and churches must be absolutely separated.

00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:35.620
We only need,

00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:38.120
in order to do this...

00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:42.120
In order to do this, we only need to implement the law.

00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:48.520
Without excessive impatience,

00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:51.340
without mixing up what comes from the law,

00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:53.760
and what comes from personal convitctions.

00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:58.160
But with the calm confidence

00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:00.040
of those who know

00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:02.240
that in any case,

00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:04.140
every one of us

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:06.100
would be on the front line

00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:10.200
if the freedom of any one of us was blamed,

00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:11.900
whatever the content.

00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:16.500
In the end,

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:19.380
the law must be implemented.

00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:21.960
And in order to do this,

00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:25.180
first and before numerous discussions,

00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:27.620
it must be implemented everywhere,

00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:29.220
to everyone,

00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:31.220
and in the same conditions.

00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:36.700
In particular,

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:39.740
all territories of the republic

00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:42.060
have to receive

00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:46.180
the beneficial secularity of the State.

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:49.820
That's why all the concordatory systems,

00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:54.760
those of Alsace-Moselle, Guyane, and all other concerned territories

00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:56.300
will all be abrogated.

00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:09.700
Enter even further

00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:13.200
in the duties that freedom sets for you.

00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:21.080
Freedom of conscience has an obvious twin,

00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:24.120
a fundamental human liberty:

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:28.600
the one to entirely and absolutely manage  youself.

00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:32.160
It is thus time...

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:35.720
It is thus time to write in the constitution

00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:39.080
the right to abortion, because the body of each woman...

00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:45.860
...because the body of each woman

00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:50.160
absolutely and exclusively belongs to herself.

00:38:54.960 --> 00:39:00.540
This liberty has to be written in the constitution

00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:06.840
so that it is never again submitted to electoral jolts,

00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:10.100
like those we observed in numerous countries,

00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:12.640
in Poland or in USA,

00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:14.620
with the results we know.

00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:23.780
Our country is not protected from such infamies.

00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:27.940
It is an inalienable right,

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:31.720
and the constitution has to solemnly declare it.

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:43.580
In the same state of mind,

00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:52.520
having first in mind and in heart the idea of what human diginity is,

00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:58.340
to which every one of us deeply aspire ;

00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:01.660
with this in mind,

00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:04.660
I personally support

00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:07.580
- the Constituent will state it -

00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:12.820
that we write in the fundamental law

00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:16.940
the right to assisted suicide.

00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:21.780
When comes the time

00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:28.840
to confront what we cannot do anything against

00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:35.100
other than enforcing your freedom to switch off the light,

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:38.400
then you need the helping hand to assist you.

00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:51.180
Ultimate freedom, that gives all its meaning to a truly humane life.

00:40:55.600 --> 00:41:00.500
Those individual rights are new, of course,

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:04.880
just like the circumstances and the means that enabled their appearance.

00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:13.580
Of course, we could not defend the freedom and the neutrality of the Internet before it existed.

00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:20.640
But because it exists, it is then a basic freedom that must be warranted.

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:33.100
The constituent work has to meet the challenges of its time,

00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:39.500
and firstly to the one that is laid down to the whole human comminity

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:44.960
and that threatens the longevity of the civilisation itself.

00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:46.940
For the moment,

00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:49.700
the greatest challenge of all,

00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:58.960
and the greatest responsibility before anything else for a great nation technically advanced like ours,

00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:02.160
it is that climate change has begun

00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:06.565
and that we need to know if we respond every man for itself,

00:42:06.565 --> 00:42:08.240
or all together.

00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:14.800
Of course,

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:22.340
we don't need to change the constitution to organise environmental planning,

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:25.820
move on to 100% renewable energy,

00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:31.720
quit nuclear energy,

00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:36.720
and break up with the abominable chemical agriculture,

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:44.780
that is now poisoning the upcoming generations and creates malformations.

00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:53.080
Although we don't need it for all of this because the law will provide for it,

00:42:53.080 --> 00:43:00.560
we have the duty to set ourself an imperative general rule

00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:05.900
that makes us change our ways of producing,

00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:07.900
and of trading,

00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:09.680
and of consuming.

00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:17.540
This rule is "the Green Rule"

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:24.360
It is better

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:28.480
and more useful than their so-called "golden rule",

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:30.480
the only virtue they honour.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.540
We recover from lack of money,

00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:37.720
we would not recover from the destruction of our world.

00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:43.400
The Green Rule

00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:48.800
is not taking more from nature than what it can recover.

00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:54.320
This technical and scientific challenge

00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:59.480
is the key to the new humanism of which we carry the flag.

00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:07.580
We have to decide once and for all to move in this direction

00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:17.180
as far as possible in our understanding of what matters nowadays like we never realised before in times past.

00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:20.300
We have to decide

00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:23.480
that there are inalienable common goods,

00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:26.260
that air and water are these common goods.

00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:34.900
As well as knowledge,

00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:42.920
art, and culture,

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:45.100
that improve

00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:46.820
what is humane inside us.

00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:50.520
But these common goods,

00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:53.180
air, water,

00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:57.340
must be the public property of the nation.

00:44:57.820 --> 00:45:02.840
It is the nation's duty to protect them

00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:07.140
and to make those who destroy them pay for their repair.

00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:13.380
Let's go!

00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:16.060
Let's move even more forward!

00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:19.580
In the end,

00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:23.040
we have to build a new state of mind.

00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:27.700
We have to admit for good

00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:29.700
that the biosphere is a whole

00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:32.020
that must be respected as it is.

00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:36.860
We thus have to admit and write in our constitution

00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:41.280
that we prohibit the patenting of life.

00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:50.700
And most likely

00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:54.060
we will have to declare as well

00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:57.680
as a rule for ever

00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:05.640
as a proof of our collective improvement

00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:15.360
the rule that animals are not things,

00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:19.740
and that the proof

00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:23.000
of our conscious humanity

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:28.800
is certified when we decide to enforce this principle.

00:46:36.220 --> 00:46:40.720
I cannot leave this square

00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:44.900
and finish what I have to say

00:46:44.900 --> 00:46:47.280
without asking you to look at her.

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:53.760
The bronze Marianne here

00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:56.580
holds in her fingertips

00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:57.800
an olive branch.

00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:00.980
Think about it.

00:47:00.980 --> 00:47:03.280
Think about it strongly!

00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:05.280
It is the symbol of peace.

00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:15.780
All of you, here,

00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:20.820
and you that are listening to us at that moment,

00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:23.640
hear what is our common duty.

00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:30.040
Peace is a precious good that must be cherished and protected.

00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:40.680
In Europe, and in the world, wars spread,

00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:43.940
weapons accumulate,

00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:48.400
tensions of domination excite

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:50.400
on all seas,

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:51.900
on all continents.

00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:58.560
Bellicose leaders are facing each other,

00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:02.500
in Europe as well...

00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:05.060
[Man screaming] Great. I'd like to talk.

00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:09.600
Europe...

00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:12.800
Listen to me...

00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:14.800
Europe...

00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:36.440
I said, bellicose leaders are facing each other, and in Europe as well.

00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:39.500
We, France,

00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:45.960
have a useful and key role to play

00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:51.640
to build and organise peace from now on threatened.

00:48:52.740 --> 00:48:56.120
We must not accept

00:48:56.120 --> 00:49:01.520
that, according to the terrible words of the current president of the republic,

00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:05.200
Europe re-enters the race with defence,

00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:10.540
because Europe of defence

00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:12.240
is Europe of war.

00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:16.640
Europe of defence?

00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:18.640
But against who?

00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:20.320
But with who?

00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:22.060
What for?

00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:24.560
We know too well

00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:27.480
the chain of events that one word after the other

00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:29.900
drags up to a point

00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:32.240
where nobody controls anything anymore.

00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:35.640
Our history is completely full of those,

00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:39.480
and our people have been martyred enough

00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:42.440
so that we became vigilant.

00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:58.060
France has to be an indepedent power,

00:49:58.060 --> 00:50:01.620
politically and militarily.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:12.340
It has to refuse to be dragged by automatic alliances systems

00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:17.000
into conflicts that could emerge here and there

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:22.460
and that in the end it would not have anything else to know but to try to prevent them.

00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:25.100
We want peace

00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:31.740
and thus we will leave NATO if this resonsibility is ours.

00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:40.500
France, on our initiative...

00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:52.660
Crowd: Resistance! Resistance!

00:50:52.660 --> 00:50:58.720
France, on our initiative,

00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:03.820
will extend the hand of friendship to every people

00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:11.780
that refuse to follow behind either of the empires that nowadays dominate the world.

00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:20.100
France will build an unaligned alliance,

00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:24.860
pacific, working for peace in all circumstances.

00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:33.880
But if we take such a way,

00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:41.500
then of course, we will have to start by removing from the contitution

00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:46.000
this dangerous and absurd measure

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:50.140
that allows a single man to decide of a war.

00:51:55.780 --> 00:52:06.320
It is necessary so that France leaves this aggressive escalation into which it has been dragged for ten years,

00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:10.060
and into which its weapons have been committed

00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:13.620
in a very dangerous and hazardous way

00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:19.380
without ever knowing when what has been started could end well,

00:52:19.380 --> 00:52:22.940
for the reason that we do not have any kind of idea when starting.

00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:27.360
Our march

00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:32.540
demonstrates that we are able to lead the country.

00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:43.200
We are able to make our homeland a point of reference

00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:46.980
for the great challenges that the universal humanity has to take up.

00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:51.760
For my part,

00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:53.600
I am prepared for it.

00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:03.860
Our march today,

00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:07.200
our will to build a new France

00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:10.680
by building its sixth republic,

00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:14.400
is in keeping with this fundamental thought,

00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:17.960
expressed by the great JaurÃ¨s:

00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:21.060
"political democracy

00:53:21.060 --> 00:53:24.520
"comes down to one central idea

00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:29.860
"or even a single idea:

00:53:29.860 --> 00:53:34.220
"the political sovereignty of the people."

00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:41.220
In the past,

00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:47.220
France often needed to go through great ordeals

00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:51.000
to then be able to pull itself together.

00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:56.660
It is often with tumult and storm

00:53:56.660 --> 00:54:01.260
that everything broke and that everything was then to rebuild.

00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:11.440
We now offer a great and profound radical change,

00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:18.020
peacefully, pacifically, democratically acquired,

00:54:18.020 --> 00:54:22.560
by the collective debate of an assembly,

00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:28.340
composed of elected members or randomly selected among French people.

00:54:34.420 --> 00:54:38.160
O you my people,

00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:44.640
you have to change everything if you don't want everything to change against you.

00:54:46.060 --> 00:54:50.720
You have to do this civic revolution,

00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:56.260
if you don't want to endure an ethnic coup d'Ã©tat,

00:54:56.260 --> 00:54:58.600
or a financial coup d'etat,

00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:00.320
or both together.

00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:20.000
It is thus to the people, to you, to proceed to the radical separation of the state, of democracy, of our humane duties on one hand,

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:23.140
from money on the other hand.

00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:26.460
Folks!

00:55:26.460 --> 00:55:28.460
Folks, listen!

00:55:29.060 --> 00:55:32.780
We now have to show what the sovereign people is worth.

00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:42.140
Ballot papers have to make the clean sweep that makes them all without exception clear off.

00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:56.440
Crowd: Resistance! Resistance!

00:55:56.440 --> 00:56:10.700
Crowd: Clear off! Clear off!

00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:14.460
After "Resistance!", a new watchword is born.

00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:15.680
It is "Clear off!"

00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:35.360
Crowd: Clear off! Clear off!

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:41.180
Clear off, so that the privileges of finance be abolished,

00:56:41.180 --> 00:56:47.120
those of the insolent caste that holds all powers and share them out,

00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:53.240
those of the presidential monarchy and of all the golden suites of the capital.

00:56:54.200 --> 00:57:00.640
Think big, French people, think big for your homeland.

00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:12.780
You will never do it as well as by reading the poets that sang France,

00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:18.000
and that help you, help us, in particular.

00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:25.140
I will finish my words, me too, with Victor Hugo.

00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:29.540
I give you this text

00:57:29.540 --> 00:57:33.440
as a personal message,

00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:35.820
for ever,

00:57:35.820 --> 00:57:41.900
and as a signal of the gratitude I feel at that moment,

00:57:41.900 --> 00:57:44.680
like so many other before,

00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:47.500
for the honour you did me

00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:50.380
by naming me as your spokesperson.

00:57:58.760 --> 00:58:00.980
Through me,

00:58:00.980 --> 00:58:02.980
let every little French woman,

00:58:02.980 --> 00:58:06.760
every little French man,

00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:12.700
especially if he comes from far,

00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:19.580
know that there is no greater heart than that of this country,

00:58:19.580 --> 00:58:23.880
that it is not true that he dedicated itself to hate,

00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:28.240
that it is always open to offer a helping hand,

00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:34.660
for help, mutual protection, joy,  happiness to be together.

00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:43.200
Go on, speak, Victor Hugo!

00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:51.260
"Throughout the earth to-day the name of France is revolution ;

00:58:51.260 --> 00:58:58.640
"and henceforth this word 'revolution' will be the name of civilisation,

00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:04.500
"until it can be replaced by the word 'harmony'."

00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:14.620
'Harmony', like this Phi we chose to symbolise who we are at that time in history.

00:59:14.620 --> 00:59:16.620
[From the crowd] - Revolution!

00:59:20.060 --> 00:59:22.760
"Ay!", says Victor Hugo,

00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:29.460
"every one of us, great and small, powerful and despised, illustrious and obscure,

00:59:29.460 --> 00:59:31.760
"in all our works, good or bad,

00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:36.660
"whatever they may be, poems, dramas, romances, history, philosophy,

00:59:36.660 --> 00:59:40.340
"at the tribune of assemblies as before the crowds of the theatre

00:59:40.340 --> 00:59:42.920
"or in solitary meditation ;

00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:46.040
"Ay! everywhere and always ;

00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:49.100
"Ay! to combat violence and imposture ;

00:59:49.100 --> 00:59:53.300
"Ay! to restore those who are stoned and run down ;

00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:57.240
"Ay! to draw logical conclusions and to march straight onward ;

00:59:57.240 --> 01:00:03.380
"Ay! to console, to succour, to relieve, to encourage, to teach ;

01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:06.720
"Ay! to dress wounds, in hope of curing them !

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:17.240
"Ay! to transform charity into fraternity, alms into helpfulness, sloth into industry, idleness into usefulness,

01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:19.520
"[...] to convert iniquity to justice,

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:40.060
"[...] the populace into the people, the rabble into the nation, nations into humanity, war into love, prejudice into free inquiry, frontiers into welded joints, barriers into thoroughfares, ruts into rails, vestry-rooms into temples, the instinct of evil into the desire of good, life into right, kings into men ;

01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:43.920
"Ay! to deprive religions of hell, and societies of the prison-den ;

01:00:43.920 --> 01:01:03.800
"Ay! to be brothers to the wretched, the serf, the fellah, the poor labourer, the disinherited, the victim, the betrayed, the conquered, the sold, the shackled, the sacrificed, [...], the convict, the ignorant, the savage, the slave, the negro, the condemned, the damned ;

01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:06.940
"Ay! for all these things we're thy sons, O Revolution !"

01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:39.600
Crowd: Resistance! Resistance!

01:01:39.600 --> 01:02:25.760
[Marseillaise: first verse]

01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:48.260
[Marseillaise: chorus]

01:02:55.740 --> 01:03:04.360
Crowd: Resistance! Resistance!

01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:50.000
[Marseillaise: sixth verse]

01:03:50.000 --> 01:04:13.160
[Marseillaise: chorus]

01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:15.160
[From the crowd] - Revolution!

01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:37.060
[From the crowd] - The Internationale!

01:04:42.540 --> 01:04:46.080
Crowd: MÃ©lenchon, president! MÃ©lenchon, president!

01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:50.840
It has sometimes been said

01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:54.480
that on the grounds that I appear before all,

01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:57.400
I would have forgotten where I come from and who I am,

01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:59.860
and what is my motherland in the old days.

01:04:59.860 --> 01:05:03.780
Then in this anniversary day of the Paris Commune,

01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:06.540
it is now to us, for those who know it,

01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:12.160
to strike up in memory of our family, who died for freedom, the Internationale.

01:05:16.760 --> 01:06:22.160
[The Internationale]

01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:46.100
Let every one of us do what she has to do.

01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:53.560
As for me, I will take with all my heart and all my strength the part of work that is mine,

01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:56.580
and I very much hope that every one of you does the same.

01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:59.240
Long live the Republic, long live France!

01:07:14.140 --> 01:07:18.880
Crowd: MÃ©lenchon, president! MÃ©lenchon, president!
