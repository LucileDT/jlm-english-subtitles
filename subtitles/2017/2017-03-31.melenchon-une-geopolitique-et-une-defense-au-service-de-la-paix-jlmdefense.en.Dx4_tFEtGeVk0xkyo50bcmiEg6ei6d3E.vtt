00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.780
[...] only because of this, my candidacy is concerned with the management of our armies,

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.700
since the Head of State is the Commander-in-Chief in the Constitution of the 5th Republic.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:24.940
I therefore could not consider my candidacy without thinking about this aspect of the mission

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.280
that the people entrusts to the man or the woman it elects.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:40.180
I've been doing this for a long time because I know that resorting to force is a serious task in the life of our societies.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:50.560
It is irreversible, and avoiding to resort to it requires difficult efforts.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:04.400
I did it because, as many of you, I have a passion for the history of france, and force played a role in this history.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.740
It has not always been the same role over the years, but it has been a decisive one when, for example,

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.100
as was said a few minutes ago, the Great Revolution of 1789 proclaimed

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:28.680
liberty and equal rights for all human beings, which brought down the old regime,

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:37.360
and prompted, only because the revolution occurred, a reaction that began not in the form of arguments but in the form of armies.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:45.840
It is clear that the Europe of the allied feudal lords first wanted to crush the French Revolution by force,

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.320
or, in other words, to crush the people.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.940
For–we should not forget it–all these changes were primarily those that the people wanted and carried out.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:05.040
Then, in a less remote past, we were force to experience the shame

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.220
of the defeat that was organized by incompetent officers

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:21.560
who caused the disaster of the 1940 defeat against the Nazi enemy, who was not only the neighbor that invaded us for the fourth time,

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:31.300
but who was above all the army that carried an ideology and a worldview that was the complete opposite of identity of the French nation,

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:37.600
and always with regard to the same point: the equal rights of human beings.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:49.460
We could mention the numerous circumstances during which force served ideas

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.280
— the worst ideas on some occasions, the best ideas on others.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:02.660
No one can claim to run our great country without taking into account the fact that it is the fifth economic power in the world...

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:09.480
We are either the fifth or the fourth military power in the world.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:22.560
Of course, neither our manpower, nor our means, or even our doctrines can be compared to the first and most dangerous power:

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:30.700
the USA and their huge budget of 600 billion dollars for military spendings,

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:42.240
and their capacity to control 80% of the world military spending through NATO and through their regional military alliances.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:58.560
However, force, and the capacity to use it in retaliation is not insignificant, neither in our history nor in our present.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:06.820
I share the diagnosis that was presented here by those who spoke before me.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:14.900
Colonel, you are right in saying that we did not ask you who you want to vote for.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:24.320
And we will not ask any of the experts on defence issues who they want to vote for.

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:32.160
Because to us, all the French are summoned whatever their opinions when it comes to contribute to the common good

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:42.680
in this supreme moment that we always want to postpone: the moment when we have to defend the fatherland and carry weapons.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.240
You are right, and we will keep on doing so.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:58.480
I am very proud that military and civil personnel who care about defence issues turn to us,

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.060
although they probably never thought about doing it,

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.280
but who found something that resonates with what they believe to be right and necessary for the country,

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:18.120
because we are in pursuit of independence, in a situation that more than ever requires independence.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.240
This is what I am about to explain.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.220
Nevertheless, I will not start without thanking you all.

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:34.680
We heard, and you know it by now, that my staff, that is composed of men and women of all ages,

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:46.820
is able to know, to organize, to plan, to disciplin, to treat all the themes that correspond to defence tasks,

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.420
be they issues of equipment or industrial strategy,

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:59.120
or the good understanding of the peculiar place of the arms industry within France's industrial process as a whole,

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.740
or the political view of the use of force.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:09.100
Ladies and gentlemen, don't underestimate this capacity.

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:16.660
We have seen where ill-considered or miscalculated decisions could lead us,

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:22.380
or more exactly, decisions that were taken for short-term interests and whose consequences we keep paying the consequences,

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:27.800
because we caused even greater catastrophe than the one we suffered from

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:38.080
—I think about the intervention in Libya, that was the starting point of the spreading of arms and disorder in all Africa.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:50.700
Moreover, I cannot forget the way the decision was taken and thanks to which arrangements everyone was deceived.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:07:00.280
For if the UNO Security Council unanimously decided—including the vote of China and Russia—

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.620
that there would indeed be no-fly zones

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:12.380
to prevent Muammar Gaddafi, the dictator, to bomb some of the positions held by the popular uprising,

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.520
this decision of the UNO was transformed into something very different,

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:23.280
and understood as a blank check and a right to intervene, to bomb, to destroy and to bring down the regime,

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:29.200
although no political decision for the future was taken, more especially by the Libyan people,

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:35.240
to say nothing of the French people, who supplied the means for this deplorable intervention.

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:41.560
And now, since we know all about this, we need to treat this issue seriously.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:48.400
To this aim, as far as we are concerned, and for the coherence of our doctrine,

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:53.760
I would like to remind you that the key to the citizens' revolution

00:07:53.760 --> 00:08:00.240
is the fact that the people takes the power back in all the domains that concern its collective power.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:05.000
Of course, the issue of defence is absolutely essential,

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:11.060
and consequently, there is a logical and deep relation between the will to make these issues public

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:18.700
and the will to restore conscription that was suppressed, as you remember.

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:24.600
Since I am old enough to have experience and thanks to the functions I was in charge,

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:28.320
I participated in the debate on the abolition of conscription,

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:32.860
and I was opposed to this abolition, contrary to the party of which I was a member at the time.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:40.640
I was opposed to it, and I heard arguments that I heard again later,

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.600
that said our armies needed professionalization.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:48.960
There was no need to be a smart cookie to understand where this would lead us.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:54.200
And, already at the time, I argued that before the abolition of conscription,

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:57.560
the French armies were not composed of amateurs.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:02.200
On the contrary, they were at their highest professionally speaking,

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:07.780
since they profited from the contribution of the highly educated young people of our country,

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:15.600
whose contribution was priceless, because so much intelligence and skills was gathered in so few places.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:27.480
Therefore, the plan that we are presenting is built around popular intervention in issues of defence again

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:35.300
—defence theory and the use of the means of defence. But before that, we need to assess the threats we are facing clearly.

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:42.760
This is why I'll start by saying that I will not answer the question on the level of public spending

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:47.880
that is necessary to defence by repeating, as all the parrots do,

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:53.320
that we need a 2% defence budget, although they never say to which aim such a budget would be devoted,

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.220
nor for what reason they decided on a 2% budget.

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:59.540
It is not because they have more ideas in this domain than in others,

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:03.820
but it is simply because this figure was decided upon by NATO,

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:10.940
i.e. the military alliance run by North-Americans, who told them we needed to devote 2% of our countries' GDP to defence.

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:16.800
They did so not to define a defence—I mean a threat, sorry—to which this 2% budget would respond,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.120
but they did so to make us buy equipment "off-the-shelf"—to use their elegant formulation—

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:27.540
of which a major part is supposed to come from American equipment, or to be directly related to it,

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:31.840
because, as we know, the liberal North-Americans,

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:37.340
although they are opposed to taxation, to the state, and to more or less everything but trade and arrangements,

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:40.720
have always had a more than keynesian policy,

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:46.760
since it consists in plowing billions and billions of dollars in a single shot into the defence of their country,

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:51.080
with the effect of setting all sorts of industries in motion and, as you know, the arms industry

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:57.600
can perfectly be a driving force for the rest of the industry, since it uses materials of all sorts.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:01.220
What distingues it from other activities is its purpose,

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:07.900
and the fact that the market, if I may say so, is entirely defined, controled, organized and financed by the state.

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:11.180
This contradicts the opinion of liberals, but it doesn't seem to be a problem for them.

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:15.040
Mr Reagan, who was the onset of the liberal period, did it

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:19.120
by presenting one of the most important military budgets of the post-war years,

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:29.080
and Mr Trump apparently wishes to take up this plan within the frame of his redefinition of USA's geopolitical activities.

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:33.380
Therefore, prior to defining how much we want to spend,

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:39.020
we will start by asking ourselves what the threats the world in general is facing.

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:42.540
I don't want to list all these threats, but I would like to mention some of them.

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:51.020
It is my duty to do so at the moment of making decisions, whatever the domain.

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:59.420
These threats cannot be defined by as wooly concepts as that of "making war on terrorism",

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:05.360
whose major drawback is that it says nothing of terrorists, and whose supreme drawback

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:13.860
is that it says nothing of the link between these terrorists and the material, regional powers that vie with one another

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.760
for extremely precise material interests.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:25.960
For the most part, terrorism is one of the methods of warfare of regional powers that use terrorist attacks

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:36.300
to destabilize countries that they consider to be their enemies, religion being a pretext, and not the reason why they act.

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:41.900
So let's look at what our world is confronted with from above.

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:50.640
Geopolitical disorder is the mother of all wars, that is, the moment when borders are crossed, for a reason or another,

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:58.400
when some nations are forced to move from one place to another, or when the authority of some prevails over the authority of others in one place.

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:07.640
We know, because it is an old anthropological concept, that the first human political community is not family.

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:13.500
It is the human group that exerts its authority on its members and its territory.

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:19.520
As a consequence, when the limits of this authority change, disorder settles down,

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:25.120
and disorder can lead to situations in which issues are settled by violence and force.

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:33.580
Today, we are confronted with a rising tide of disorder that will mechanically come from climate change.

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:43.460
Climate change, by empoverishing certain regions, because of the change in the cycles of rains destroys agriculture,

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:49.500
or because of other reasons that modify the balance of the ecosystem of these regions,

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:54.820
drives immense populations to move from one place to another and to occupy territories,

00:13:54.820 --> 00:14:01.320
regardless of the borders they cross or where these borders are, as long as they have somewhere to go.

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:10.820
Moreover, in some regions of the world, since borders were set along ethnic and cultural lines thar are extremely coherent,

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:14.780
it seems natural to these populations to go from one place to another,

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:18.660
because they know they will find family and speak the same language.

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:24.360
Therefore, the borders of dozens of states are swaying.

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:31.380
Dozens of regional alliances, of regional cooperations are swaying or being destroyed by these movements of population.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:38.480
Let's remember that 80% of te movements of population caused by climate change take place between Southern countries

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:43.080
and that the impact on the so-called Northern countries is but a side effect.

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:53.720
The number of economic refugees that cross the borders of Europe is barely equivalent to the number of people that migrate from Europe to the rest of the world,

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:58.320
because of the absurd policies of the EU that deprive, for other reasons than climate change,

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:02.260
the younger generation and the nations of social perspectives of development.

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:09.900
To make long story short, millions of people—Spaniards, Portugueses, Greeks—are forced to leave Europe.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:14.280
Even Germans, since 25,000 young Germans leave Germany every year,

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:19.220
but also French people, although we don't know how many, since no one ever tries to establish a figure

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:24.960
for fear of comparing this figure with that of the people that enter our country.

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:31.000
Climate change will therefore cause innumerable upheavals.

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:34.800
And the response to climate change is not a military one,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:42.580
although the security of borders can quickly lead certain states to resort to force to protect their borders,

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:45.780
since they fear these borders to be jeopardized by these movements of population.

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:55.020
We therefore need preventive measures before any outbreak of catastrophes, measures that are part of a defence policy,

00:15:55.020 --> 00:16:01.060
if we accept to consider that, one problem leading to another, and the next to the the one that follows,

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:07.240
as with dominoes, makes a bad harvest in one place have bad consequences in Europe.

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:14.480
The second cause of these troubles and disorders is that production-oriented economy drives us to an ever-increasing

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:22.080
and always irresponsible use of raw materials, and leads some, because of today's extremely sophisticated productions,

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:31.320
to monopolize rare goods—like rare lands for instance—that has some countries compete with one another to control them.

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:37.060
Of course, these goods, these resources and these raw materials are not available everywhere,

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:40.240
so much so that those who have them at their disposal are subject to pressure,

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.960
and become the focus of attention that is of course never disinterested,

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:51.820
even though this attention sometimes takes the form of sympathetic struggles for the right of such and such population to self-determination,

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:56.540
populations that are attacked by imperialist powers to cause disorder that destroy nations.

00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:00.680
The race for raw materials gets worse

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:08.960
because climate modifies seaways and clears new areas on which no one had any authority until now,

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:14.400
particularly in deep waters, which are the domain of res nullius,

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:18.060
meaning they belong to no one, and as a consequence, first come, first served.

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:22.580
Today, an organization of the exploitation of these areas is beggining to take shape,

00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:28.260
but it remains embryonic, and consists in organizing alternate exploitation, as it were.

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:32.380
It is not a right of common goods, especially concerning deep waters.

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:36.680
But before we consider the issue of deep waters, there is the issue of continental plateaus.

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:42.820
France was intelligent enough, under Lionel Jospin's government, to act in time

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:50.000
when the UNO proposed that each country define more precisely the extent of its territory at sea

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:56.820
and be capable of demonstrating the continuity between its continental plateau, and the immediate surrounding of its shores,

00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:02.720
and more remote territories: these territories are considered to be exclusive areas.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:10.800
This enabled our country's surface to increase by 10% without shooting a single bullet in the course of the years 2000.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.620
But you should not forget that there are more tense situations at present.

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:26.260
You heard about ice melt, and you know that the parts of the poles that was until now frozen are decreasing.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:29.000
You should know that below these areas are great natural resources,

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:36.060
and we find around the North Pole, within the range of missiles, as it were, a competition

00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:44.600
between the USA, Russia, Denmark, Sweden and Norway to know who's going to control these territories.

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:50.660
Don't believe that these issues can be settled amicably only,

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:54.940
and this is probably the reason why conscription was restored in one of these countries.

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:58.860
I guarantee you that it has nothing to do with the language barrier.

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:06.480
It is because something is at stake militarily which causes tension to mount: it is the access to raw materials.

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:13.560
Dear friends, if you want to understand the conflicts of the last ten years, follow the oil and gas pipelines,

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:15.300
because wars break out along them.

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:23.040
Since the war in Afghanistan, that didn't have much to do with Twin Towers, but that had much to do with the map of pipelines,

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:26.600
when we asked ourselves if they would go towards China or Europe,

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:33.500
and once the issue was settled, well we packed up our equipment in the disastrous conditions you are aware of,

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:37.320
but we did it, and it is said that the war is over in this country.

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:43.860
Of course, women there enjoy great liberties, and the people has known a development

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:48.100
thanks to the presence of all these armies that we can be proud of,

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:58.000
even though 85% of the money that was plowed into the innumerable contingents in this wretched country

00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:03.260
ended up in the coofers of western countries, who had decided on the spendings.

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:06.200
I'm just saying this as a reminder in case you would not know.

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:10.200
Third element: threats.

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:17.320
My first element was cimate change; the second was the pressure exerted on the ecosystem by the production-oriented system,

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:22.940
and the conclusion we should draw is that an ecological policy is a policy of peace,

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:27.600
since it results in bringing this pressure and this predation down on the one hand,

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:31.580
but more importantly because it would enable us to avoid using a number of raw materials.

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:38.020
For instance, if France stopped using fossil energies, in the same way as we will stop using nuclear power,

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:43.680
in order to use 100% renewable energies, we would save half of our foreign trade spendings,

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:45.900
because these spendings are composed of gas and oil.

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:53.960
Thus, an ecological policy is essentially a policy of peace and savings, contrary to what we usually hear.

00:20:55.080 --> 00:21:04.220
Last but not least, I'll deal with the various forms of domination in geopolitics.

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:10.940
A lot of experts on these issues are here today, and I advise you not to lecture at them.

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:19.040
However, I am a political leader, and the issue of the balances of power is of particular interest to me,

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:25.780
because after all, politics is all about attempts to settle in a peaceful and orderly way

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:31.700
the balances of power that emerge from contradictory interests that operate within societies.

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:39.840
Geopolitics is deeply deeply influenced by the hazardous situation of the USA.

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:45.140
The USA are the leading power in the world—I said it in the beginning of my speech.

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:52.740
But it is above all the leading monetary power, that issues billions and billions of dollars all over the world,

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.120
although they have not started to produce the least gram of matter that corresponds to these sums yet.

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:04.420
These are phoney dollars that are worth whatever you want them to.

00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:08.820
The reality is that if the dollar was reduced to its material reality

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:13.240
—as if you all went to the bank to convert your dollars into commodities—

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:21.080
this banknote would not even be worth the paper and the ink used to print it.

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:25.160
Believe me, a $100 banknote is not worth $100,

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:35.920
and this stack of money—that until now flowed freely, since the USA finance their debt by printing money

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:42.720
and that from time to time, more sophisticated and elegant expressions than "printing money" are invented ("easy something...").

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:48.980
They print and print money to buy back their debts. They've been doing this since 2008 at an unbelievably quick pace,

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:54.420
that enabled the USA to edge their way through and to overcome the huge shock of the 2008 crisis,

00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:57.580
although their economy became weaker in return.

00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:04.720
This fragility is facing peculiar circumstances: as global trade is still made with dollars,

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:09.260
the euro appeared, and it is the currency of the leading economic power

00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:13.220
as far as production, exchanges and the amount of money are concerned.

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:18.900
In the mean time, the Chinese currency appeared, almost mechanically.

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:26.600
China became the leading economic power without any imperialist policy,

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:33.280
only because this country was entrusted with the lowcost productions we did not want to take care of

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:41.980
because we did not want to increase salaries in order to buy commodities as cheaply as possible.

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:48.200
Anyway, in the mean time, contrary to what incompetent economists believed, China did not content itself

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:55.460
with producing cheap commodities like sunshades and castanets that would have made us happy.

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:58.560
China produces half of the computers in the world.

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:05.920
As you know, it has the technical capacity to destroy satellites from the Earth,

00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:14.640
the capacity to organize human space flights, to go to and to come back from space, to maintain orbital stations etc etc.

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:20.360
In short, China is at the forefront of all these techniques, and this should make us happy,

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:26.540
because it is a good things that Europeans stop lamenting the Chinese people

00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:31.280
or collecting the silver paper of chocolate bars as our parents did

00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:34.520
when the Chinese people was not capable of providing for their means of subsistance.

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:42.380
It is a good thing if 1,4 billion are autonomous and can produce high-quality goods.

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:47.780
Of course, the conditions in which they produce them are not good, and our circumspection on this point is still entire.

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:53.220
But we the French see China as a partner.

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:57.600
I suggested in my book "Let's get rid of them all" that China should be a privileged partner,

00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:02.320
which owed me to be considered a henchman of the Chinese Communist Party—which I'm not—

00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:07.400
even though it was the RPR (conservatives) that reached an agreement with the CPR at the time,

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:15.680
and I am delighted to remind you that the main leaders of the French-China associations are to be found in the UMP (conservatives),

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:18.420
and not in the Left Party or in La France Insoumise.

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:27.600
The Chinese are privileged partners for us—I'll talk about Russians later.

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:30.700
But the situation is completely different for North-Americans. Why is that?

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:38.880
China financed the US Treasury by massively buying US bonds,

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:44.960
that would be equivalent to a nuclear bomb if they decided to sell them,

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:49.620
or if they decided to use another currency for trade.

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:53.900
And it happens that China is the most important producer and exporting country in the world,

00:25:54.160 --> 00:26:02.780
so it would be normal that their currency be requested and that the countries that do trade with them wish this currency to be convertible.

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:13.980
And step by step, we see that China creates compensation funds that enable it to start organizing the conversion of part of other currencies

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:21.200
into the Chinese national currency, and I am very happy that this compensation fund is located in Paris,

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:29.860
although I am very disappointed that the train from Beijing only stops in Berlin and not in Paris.

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:33.240
But to go back to this strategic moment,

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:38.620
it is clear that the destabilization of the USA results from a mechanical situation,

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:43.480
and not from an agressive attitude on the part of China.

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:49.500
Of course, a great power like China always has an interest in stabilizing its positions

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:53.780
and to have its borders recognised by other countries.
I will deal with the issue of borders in a moment.

00:26:54.820 --> 00:27:00.420
Some simple minds think that borders are stable and that running along these borders

00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:04.140
shouting that they are stable is enough to settle the disputes.

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:08.820
This has not been the case at all during the last thirty years, and this is not about to start,

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:16.080
especially in the case of the islands that either Russia and China, or China and Japan claim to be theirs,

00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:18.620
which create tension.

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:21.520
But the structural cause lies in this imbalance,

00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:32.540
and the USA, who have focused their efforts on containing the power of the USSR for a long tim

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:34.140
and on destroying it if possible,

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:40.340
and who, out of habit, and through a well-known phenomenon of bureaucratization

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:45.020
that sees their security agencies compete with one another, out of blindness,

00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:49.240
and out of an imperialist will to keep controlling European countries,

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:55.620
the USA still designated Russia as their main enemy for a time,

00:27:55.620 --> 00:28:06.940
after they tried to purely and simply destroy it, by tarnising its prestige, by insulting and threatening it.

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:16.180
For we should remember that the collapse of the USSR did not lead to negotiations about the reorganization of the old Soviet empire.

00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:21.420
It is one of the rare occasions in history in which the dismemberment of an empire was not negotiated.

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:28.500
I'm not saying that the dismemberments of the Austro-Hungarian and the Turkish Empires during the Versailles Treaty were a success,

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:32.920
but we at least remember that if there was a Versailles Treaty, it was because there had been a war,

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:41.600
which had already taken place for problems of borders, of access to natural resources and of competition between imperialisms.

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:48.720
And so, during the period that followed the collapse of the USSR,

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:53.720
we lied to and deceived all those we spoke to.

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:59.720
We had previously told them that NATO would not extend up to the Russian borders but we immediately did the contrary.

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:07.060
We had told them that NATO would extend up to East Germany if Germany wished to reintegrate East Germany to form a single country

00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:11.500
—which was not obvious given the history of the 20th century—

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:15.400
and that these countries would not necessarily integrate NATO.

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:19.660
Moreover, everyone thought NATO had become useless since the USSR had disappeared

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:23.080
and since there was no longer any alliance organized by Russia.

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:29.740
Of course, the USA need this alliance—whatever its name.

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:34.220
Anyway, during this period that was full of lies and provocations,

00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:39.500
thoughtless acts added to this situation, and it goes on even today.

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:42.880
They consist in constantly recruiting new countries within NATO,

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:48.560
and in moving the borders of NATO always closer to the borders of Russia.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.920
Even today, negotiations with Montenegro are taking place, after so many other countries.

00:29:54.120 --> 00:30:05.880
The 10 countries that entered the EU all at once had previously entered NATO before the EU.

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:13.300
We should understand how explosive this is within the game of world powers—for I am talking about the game of world powers!

00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:19.020
We're not living in a world where people merely think highly of one another, have good relationships,

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:24.180
drink one another's liquor and eat one another's food.

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:34.780
There are conflicts of interests between powers, and Europe is the place in the world with the greatest number of old scars caused by border issues,

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:38.520
and new wounds often appear on old scars.

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:43.340
We therefore need to be very careful about these issues.

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:50.520
François Hollande's presidency, and Mr Sarkozy's before him,

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:59.620
has been marked by complete blindness and a series of renunciations whose root cause lies in the idea that France

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:05.360
cannot be an independent nation and that it doesn't have any specific role to play in Europe.

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:10.600
Considering the innumerable provocations against Russia,

00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:17.520
and more particularly, considering François Hollande's decision—that he took as soon as he was elected—

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:25.840
to take part in the Chicago Summit and to accept the setting of antimissile missiles in Poland,

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:32.020
that were supposed to protect us from so-called Iranian missiles.

00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:36.280
Some thought that this location was curious if Iran was the target,

00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:42.980
but those who know military affairs perfectly knew that these missiles had only one objective:

00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:48.340
to threaten 75% of Russia's defence system.

00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:55.440
Russia perfectly understood this, and we can say that this decision was the beginning of an irresponsible escalation

00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:57.700
whereas there should have been negotiations.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:05.440
I tackled the issue of Russia because, as you know, US security agencies have numerous agents of influence at their disposal,

00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:11.540
and whoever says that Russians are partners today, whatever their regime,

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:21.120
whoever says that we should talk and negotiate with them—for it is the only solution to avoid a war—

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:26.540
and it's because we are pacifists—or rather in favor of peace, there's a difference—

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:31.060
and because we refuse war that we propose a discussion.

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:38.980
This is why I suggested the holding of a conference on security from the Atlantic to the Urals.

00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:42.100
I took up this old expression of General De Gaulle,

00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:52.840
because I cannot hide that the construction of our view of national defence and independence owes much to his thinking.

00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:59.180
This latter has been assessed after all these years, and it is clear that it remains relevant for the most part,

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:04.080
and fits our pacific view quite naturally.

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:08.980
In these conditions, and given the dangers we are facing,

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:15.340
and as these dangers have increased in Europe by an irresponsible and agressive policy towards Russia,

00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:18.940
who naturally responded as agressively,

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:24.300
we see that borders in Europe are called into question.

00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:25.940
They have been called into question!

00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:31.300
For the decision to make Crimea a part of Ukraine,

00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:39.920
a decision that was taken by the USSR's Communist Party's Politburo under the authority of its Secretary-General, Mr Khrushchev,

00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:48.000
is the object of absolute vigilance today and is a legal decision in terms of international conventions.

00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:52.120
Borders are borders, and they must respect a principle of intangibility.

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:58.640
But of course, when problems arise, discussions must take place by taking into account a second principle

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:01.020
that is at least as important as the first one,

00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:04.340
and this principle is the right of nations to self-determination.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.640
For some say that borders must remain intangible—and I absolutely agree—

00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:13.160
but we must address this issue.
We either talk or go to war.

00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:20.240
Talking is a better solution, and the idea of a conference is to me the most realistic solution.

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:23.660
To this aim, do we have to create new tools?

00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:26.000
No we don't, because we have the OSCE.

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:32.180
This organization already exists.
It was created after the Helsinki Accords

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:36.380
that planned mutual disarmament, nuclear disarmament more especially.

00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:42.720
This organization already exists. All we have to do is to make it work again.

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:52.200
But Europeans, because of their marked tendency towards the USA, and because of their hysteric russiophobia,

00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:54.760
left this organization aside, and they're wrong.

00:34:55.340 --> 00:35:01.280
If we had to run this country, we would make this organization work again,

00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:05.960
and France—a military power that is essential in Europe...

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:12.980
For if we are the fifth nuclear power in the world, the situation is completely different from a purely European point of view.

00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:17.520
Without a doubt, we are the second nuclear power after Russia,

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:21.200
for I consider Russia as a European nation essentially.

00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:28.800
This conference must address the issue of borders,

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:35.020
because this issue exists, especially in the case of Crimea and Ukraine.

00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:45.920
The right of nations to self-determination and the issue of borders should lead us to consider the history of Europe less naively

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:51.960
than those who want to lecture at me on this issue.

00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:53.740
The borders have moved in Europe.

00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:57.660
Should I remind you how the collapse of the former Yugoslavia,

00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:05.180
that was not negotiated and abandonned to balances of power, whereas France, under François Mitterand's presidency,

00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:10.880
had demanded that prior to recognising the independence of the countries that were about to be created,

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:16.780
these countries should first define what fate and what rights would be granted to their national minorities.

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:24.460
We were waiting, in the same way as we had been waiting during the German reunification,

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:28.500
in the course of which this same François Mitterand, in order to give France's consent,

00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:37.120
had demanded that the new eastern border of Germany be the Oder-Neisse line in Pomerania.

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:42.320
After they thought about it for a month, our German neighbors agreed.

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:51.040
Well our reasoning concerning Yugoslavia was the same considering that the Balkans had always been a powder keg.

00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:58.680
But far from following us in our wise reasoning, our German neighbors made a different choice

00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:01.860
and immediately recognised Croatia and Slovenia.

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:05.000
We should remember that in the course of their mischievous history,

00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:09.020
both these nations were Germany's allies during the First and the Second World War.

00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:10.220
This was a complete mistake,

00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:17.000
because ethnic cleansings immediately began in Croatia, and then in Serbia as a response.

00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:21.980
Let me remind you that the first state to be created was Bosnia,

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:27.920
because Bosnia refused to align with both these nations, which ended with a pathetic war,

00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:34.760
and finally, borders changed again in Yugoslavia, that was under Mr Milosevic's authority

00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:37.360
—yet another nationalist mistake—

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:42.800
when a war broke out and which ended with the creation of Kosovo.

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:49.820
Until recently, Kosovo had not been recognised by a lot of countries, by France more particularly for a long time.

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:55.740
I did not recognise Kosovo either. I never vote for any text that involves Kosovo

00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:59.500
because to me, a country was dismembered to create another country

00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:02.560
without any respect for international laws,

00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:05.740
and without any legal consultation with the countries that were concerned by this issue.

00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:10.940
I noted that those who fiercely criticized—and rightfully so—Russia's annexation of Crimea

00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:18.860
are as silent as sparrows at dusk when it comes to Kosovo.

00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:25.560
But I'll take a less painful example to show you that the issue of borders in Europe is real,

00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:28.120
in spite of those who don't want to admit it.

00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:34.060
There's at least one very recent case that calls the issue of borders again.

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:40.340
The UK has decided to leave the EU.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.920
The negotiation that the UK has undertaken doesn't matter.

00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:45.980
What matters is the decision.

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:52.300
It means that all the parts that form its territory will leave the EU.

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:56.880
However, one of these parts doesn't agree with this decision.

00:38:57.660 --> 00:39:02.120
They may be using this situation quite intelligently,

00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:07.260
but they say that since they want to remain in the EU, they cannot remain in the UK.

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:09.560
I am talking about Scotland.

00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:13.500
But it will be the case of Ireland very soon,

00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:18.880
because this time, there are negotiations and endless discussions, it's true,

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:26.280
but there's a war that has been lasting for 50 years, and even more, and this war has been very violent at times.

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:33.040
Southern Ireland doesn't want to have a frontier with Northern Ireland again, and vice versa.

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:42.040
What is the answer of the moral magistery that takes no account of the will of nations to self-determination,

00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:46.200
and that contents itself with repeating that borders are intangible?

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:52.060
I repeat that I agree on this point, but to make borders intangible, there must be talks, or it is war.

00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:54.960
Now what should our answer to Scotland be?

00:39:55.440 --> 00:40:00.800
Should we assist the English armies if England did not approve the Scottish independence?

00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:09.220
Will we help England to prevent Ireland from building the nation they have always aspired to?

00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:11.180
All this is absurd!

00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:16.800
And I'll be kind enough to leave aside the consequences

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:22.240
that would come out of the not so improbable hypothesis of a secession of Flanders from Belgium.

00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:27.640
So we the neighbors of Belgium would have nothing to say about this?

00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:34.740
Would we content ourselves with saying that we would help an undefined entity to compel the Flemish to give up?

00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:35.740
Of course not!

00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:40.240
This would lead to a major redistribution and reorganization.

00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:49.520
My point is that all the conditions that led to wars in Europe in the past are restored,

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:55.640
and that if we let them worsen by indulging in wishful thinking,

00:40:56.060 --> 00:41:00.580
by expressing kind reproofs to one and all by arming to the teeth

00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:05.180
and by taking part in every provocation, all we do is increase the dangers of war,

00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:09.440
of military escalation and chains of events that no one will be able to control.

00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:20.060
So much for Europe.

00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:24.980
But France is concerned with other regions of the world.

00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:29.380
It is obvious that the USA have a new target.

00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:38.360
Taking their weak spots into account, that is, the dollar and their relation to the first workshop in the world,

00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:49.160
the USA—in a way that is not crazy at all, in the sense of the mental insanity attributed to Mr Trump—

00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:57.080
in a very rational way, turn towards their main rivals and try to exert on them the military pressure

00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:03.720
that they have always used to defeat those who questionned their supremacy.

00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:09.240
Thus, from the point of view of US capitalism's interests,

00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:13.420
Mr Trump very rationally turned his missiles towards China.

00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:14.880
And...

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:23.100
he uses this situation to tell us Europeans that we must club together to take care of our defence better,

00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:31.700
and some naive people in Europe say that since the USA no longer want to take care of us,

00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:33.980
we musttake care of ourselves.

00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:36.520
Goog, they are right!

00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:39.060
But take care of ourselves to do what?

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:41.760
Against whom and with whom?

00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:43.900
These are the real questions.

00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:53.520
Especially when we systematically and methodically see that in all the official texts,

00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:57.220
all the resolutions and every wishful thinking of the European Parliament,

00:42:57.320 --> 00:43:01.220
in all the statements of the Council of Ministers of the European Union

00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:05.000
as in all the scenarios examined by the EU,

00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:13.880
all these texts systematically state that there can be no European defence that is not very tightly linked to NATO.

00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:21.680
no one in Europe but your servant says that the future of our defence, of our fatherland,

00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:26.520
and maybe, if need be, of the countries that would have an interest in sharing a common defence with us,

00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:31.600
no one says that our interest is to withdraw from NATO and from this military spiral. No one!

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:41.140
This includes all my opponents in the current presidential election.

00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:45.600
Our programme is the only one that proposes our withdrawal from NATO.

00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:50.580
I wouldn't like this proposition to be understood as ideological only, although it is partly ideological.

00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:54.880
The French, who have something of Asterix in their nature,

00:43:56.740 --> 00:44:00.700
are not very fond of the empires that claim to tell them what to do.

00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:06.020
It is in our nature to rebel against any attempt to dominate us.

00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:08.480
I think it is a good idea.

00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:15.420
For we don't have any interest in contributing to the power of the Empire.

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:27.160
Consequently, our withdrawal from NATO would mean that we disagree with the strategy

00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:34.060
that is pitifully called the reviving of the European Defence project.

00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:39.160
For the European Defence project as it is described today means war.

00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:46.500
More precisely, the European Defence project as it is described in official texts today means war with Russia,

00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:51.800
because no one but Russia is defined as our rival in European official texts today,

00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:53.480
and this is absurd.

00:44:54.380 --> 00:45:02.920
This doesn't mean that we consider the Russian government as a benevolent government that is easy to deal with.

00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:04.880
That's not what I'm saying.

00:45:05.140 --> 00:45:09.160
Once again, I would like to remind you that General De Gaulle reached an agreement with Staline.

00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:11.220
And with Mao.

00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:15.980
Consequently, when the time comes, I'll find a way to come to an understanding with Mr Putin

00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:18.760
in order to prevent war in EUrope.

00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:22.360
This is the way we should tackle these problems.

00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:30.100
We cannot be members of NATO because this would amount to adhering to a war in Europe.

00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:36.920
However, we have other interests that bring us together with other nations.

00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:43.960
First, we have common points with some nations due to the current circumstances

00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:47.640
because they are capable of resisting.

00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:50.480
I think about the BRICS countries,

00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:56.080
an alliance of emerging countries that is hounded by the USA,

00:45:56.260 --> 00:46:00.920
militarily , as in the case of Russia and China,

00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:05.340
politically, as in the case of the coup d'état in Brazil.

00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:10.060
This becomes obvious if we think about the fact that Brzail is a member of the BRICS countries.

00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:21.200
And in this context, we the French could become the new asset of a new proposition.

00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:25.740
A new military and geopolitical proposition.

00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:33.540
An alliance of countries that refuse to align with empires, whatever the empires in question.

00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:39.840
An alliance that would give up the use of imperial practices.

00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:48.700
An alliance that would focus on highlighting and protecting the rights of nations to self-determination.

00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:52.680
This is the doctrine that I propose before you.

00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:56.060
Moreover, I think it would be approved of,

00:46:57.200 --> 00:47:03.900
by French-speaking countries especially, with whom we have relations

00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:12.100
that I would like to integrate in France's strategic vision in the course of the next decades.

00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:17.900
The community of French-speaking countries could move on to a political stage in numerous domains

00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:26.440
on the condition that we accept the obvious objective of equal relationships between our countries.

00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:32.040
This community could get a better name than "Francophonie", like "the common language",

00:47:32.580 --> 00:47:38.440
but it is obvious that the "Francophonie" will go through a revolution in the course of the next three decades

00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:50.540
because the leading human group that will share our language will be Africa.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:48:01.500
And African nations, through their development and the human multitudes that are trying to build a common future,

00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:10.960
will fertilize the language itself, its attributes, our common imagination and thinking.

00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:17.160
With the objective of a political French-speaking community in mind, we need to prepare

00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:22.640
to a relationship in which Africa would be a driving force,

00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:28.300
or in which it would at least have specific responsibilities that it does not have yet,

00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:31.060
but that Africa will mechanically have in the future.

00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:35.540
This situation would be beneficial to France in every possible way,

00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:41.780
first because it will put an end to the despicable cancer of corruption

00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:50.060
that comes from this group of allied French and African bandits called "France-Africa", which is a disgrace for all of us.

00:48:56.720 --> 00:49:02.560
It would also be beneficial to us because it would enable us to completely rethink our relationships.

00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:09.020
Of course, there is the European Union. I won't explain to you our Plans A and B again, which is our way of renegotiating,

00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:13.720
but the political "Francophonie" is by far the safest way of securing the future of France.

00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:18.820
We will soon be the third group of speakers in the world.

00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:26.880
This will greatly help us from a cultural, industrial, technical, human and artistic point of view.

00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:32.340
I'd like you to think about this, and as far as I'm concerned, I do more than think about it: I make propositions.

00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:40.320
In our programme, there is not only what we said about geopolitical and defence issues,

00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:43.060
but we also issued a booklet on the theme of the "Francophonie".

00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:46.340
I'll get closer to my conclusion

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:51.420
by addressing the questino of our armies more concretely and directly.

00:49:53.800 --> 00:50:00.180
Earlier on, I tackled the issue of the threats that influence our thinking

00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:03.760
and that force us to think about the future in new conditions.

00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:10.180
No generation before us had to take climate change as a geopolitical factor into account. None!

00:50:10.740 --> 00:50:12.920
We are the first generation to take it into account.

00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:20.440
But in the domain of the military balances of power,

00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:27.500
a revolution is taking place, a revolution that is as important as the revolution that occurred when nuclear weapons appeared.

00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:37.920
This revolution sort of reduced all the other revolutions to a specific level of use for so-called intermediate conflicts.

00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:43.620
We the French, because of our nuclear deterrence doctrine, don't want to hear about intermediate conflicts.

00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:45.900
To us, intermediate conflicts don't exist.

00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:48.760
We don't want any conflict to appear at all.

00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:53.700
Of course, to conclude this subject,

00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:58.720
we should undertake initiatives concerning military nuclear power.

00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:04.760
It is clear that France must reaffirm its will of a project of denuclearization of the world

00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:10.260
that would proceed region after region, because it is the most concrete model.

00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:16.800
More particularly, it would be a good thing if the Middle East was denuclearized,

00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:19.780
because tensions are extremely high in this region.

00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:23.100
But the question will arise in Europe when the time comes.

00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:29.260
I am happy that Mr Xi Jinping, the President of the Popular Republic of China, took the initiative

00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:36.720
of proposing the holding of a new conference on global denuclearization to the UNO.

00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:41.900
And we the French, if I were to run this country,

00:51:42.060 --> 00:51:48.240
would become a driving force to achieve the objective of global military denuclearization.

00:51:49.120 --> 00:52:01.040
Since nuclear power is the ultimate weapon of France, it is obvious that we would not be the first to start denuclearization,

00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:06.760
event though we would contribute to this process from the outset in order to make things clear for everyone.

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:13.400
I'll get to the point now. A revolution just occurred in the art of war,

00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:19.380
and we just began to realize that it just started and that it is decisive.

00:52:19.660 --> 00:52:24.760
As when nuclear weapons appeared, as when crossbows appeared in the era of swords,

00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:32.840
we can say that cyberwarfare made all our material, human and technical systems of military balance of power obsolete.

00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:38.500
At least for the reason that all our equipment, for the reasons that we mentioned earlier,

00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:48.460
is heavily infested with high technologies, which make us depend on cyberlinks.

00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:58.320
In these conditions, the task that consists in equipping ourselves with cyberbrigades and cybersquads

00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:05.600
and in recruiting all those who have high -level qualifications and skills in this domain

00:53:05.700 --> 00:53:07.700
is of the utmost priority.

00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:20.660
When the time comes, if we win the elections, France will equip itself with state-of-the-art cyberwarfare weapons.

00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:30.620
We could imagine that a certain number of weapons become less necessary than they were before,

00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:39.300
and that nonlethal forms of combat—i.e. forms of combat that do not instantly kill fighters—could be deployed.

00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:45.960
Since everyone will be stupid enough to interconnect billions of devices,

00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:51.500
from fridges to pens and whatnot,

00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:58.060
or from your phones to air conditionning and ventilation—everywhere!—

00:53:58.500 --> 00:54:03.180
since everyone will make this mistake—and this process is well under way—

00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:06.660
this means that everything will be within everyone's reach!

00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:14.180
Consequently, we can ask ourselves if certain forms of intervention are now necessary.

00:54:15.220 --> 00:54:19.420
For instance, I know that there is a debate on the issue of aircraft carriers.

00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:24.020
We have one, and we use it as best we can.

00:54:25.420 --> 00:54:29.120
Some say we should have a second aircraft carrier, and we are moving towards this objective.

00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:33.360
But would this be our most clever move?

00:54:34.180 --> 00:54:36.420
I don't think so.

00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:40.740
However, since we have the second largest maritime territory in the world,

00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:47.920
and for a certain number of medium intensity,

00:54:48.180 --> 00:54:52.860
or for military interventions like the one we carried out against maritime piracy,

00:54:52.860 --> 00:54:54.680
whose solution is not cyberwarfare,

00:54:55.080 --> 00:55:03.800
we need an important naval equipment made of smaller units that would be easier to handle, better armed,

00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:11.220
and endowed with equipment that would enable us to quickly intervene where and when we would need to.

00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:19.880
As you can see, dear colonel, dear friends, we need to think about the general military doctrine

00:55:19.940 --> 00:55:22.820
rather than the priority level of threats only.

00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:27.520
We must know the threats we are facing, but we must develop a military doctrine.

00:55:28.060 --> 00:55:33.660
How does a balance of power lead to violence in the 21st century?

00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:39.540
We must use forms of violence that lessen the impact of violence.

00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:49.220
This is the way I see the general outline of the response we gave, in our booklets and in our programme,

00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:53.940
to the issues of geopolitics and defence strategy.

00:55:54.120 --> 00:56:00.260
Let me repeat it. It is useless to deal with military issues if we do not deal with geopolitics.

00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:04.480
Strategy prevails over the budget,

00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:10.260
for even if we did not have any budget, we would still have to defend our fatherland.

00:56:11.180 --> 00:56:15.060
And this is precisely why we propose the creation of a national guard.

00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:24.060
I think the terrorist attacks against our country highlighted the weak spots of our country.

00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:30.960
These weak spots are very hard to protect completely, you all know this.

00:56:31.540 --> 00:56:36.380
Of course, we need human intelligence and determined action.

00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:40.460
Less conversation and more action will be decisive.

00:56:40.460 --> 00:56:44.380
But we all know that a zero risk objective is impossible to achieve.

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:49.160
Consequently, our number one duty is to stay united.

00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:52.260
We should not give the victory to the enemy when he attacks us,

00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:58.920
by either holding some of us responsible, or by saying that some of our citizens are their accomplices.

00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:02.820
But we should learn from these attacks over the middle and the long run.

00:57:03.420 --> 00:57:05.780
There could be other terrorist attacks,

00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:14.660
and they could strike installations of a different nature than those that were struck until now.

00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:21.620
We therefore need the strength of the people to secure our collective protection.

00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:27.360
As Djordje Kuzmanovic said it earlier, we will do this step by step.

00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:30.340
I will not say something as ridicule as

00:57:30.660 --> 00:57:36.180
stating that if I am elected in May, 800,000 young people will be recruited in our army by September 2018.

00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:39.080
First of all, it would be useless.

00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:42.540
Secondly, our programme does not plan that every citizen be recruited in the army.

00:57:43.140 --> 00:57:48.500
On the contrary, we plan that the citizens set to all sorts of tasks for the human public interest.

00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:54.760
Not only for ourselves—I wanted to say this in the intervention of Djordje Kuzmanovic—

00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:58.880
but also for our neighbors, to whom we are bound by love and friendship.

00:57:59.220 --> 00:58:03.400
I think about the countries of the Mediterranean basin—be they European or Maghrebi—

00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:12.420
with whom we often suffer the same catastrophes—ecological catastrophes, wildfires, and other similar problems.

00:58:12.780 --> 00:58:17.220
The youth of our countries could join their forces in a common effort,

00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:24.320
and contribute with their countries to something that goes beyond their own countries,

00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:28.040
such as the public interest of the Mediterraneans to begin with,

00:58:28.440 --> 00:58:31.900
and then the public interest of universal humanity.

00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:36.720
This is what this force would be.

00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:42.200
We will do this step by step. I must admit that I did not understand the propositions of my opponents.

00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:45.480
I did not.

00:58:46.140 --> 00:58:50.320
I think they will cause nothing but disasters, because their thinking is very feeble,

00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:54.500
and their will to be independent is close to zero.

00:58:56.760 --> 00:59:01.340
How can someone want to cut 120,000 jobs in the public sector,

00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:04.340
take off 100 billion euros from the national budget,

00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:10.600
and in the mean time re-equip and reorganize armies—or anything else?

00:59:12.120 --> 00:59:17.520
All these people are determined to become the henchmen of the USA.

00:59:18.060 --> 00:59:24.580
They just think that once they'll take their share of what they call "smart defence",

00:59:24.980 --> 00:59:31.440
in which all these nice people will take what our good American masters will agree to distibute among them,

00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:33.200
the problems would be settled.

00:59:33.620 --> 00:59:38.940
I cannot believe that conscription could only take a month, as some of my opponents suggest.

00:59:39.300 --> 00:59:42.380
This is not conscription but a summer camp.

00:59:46.500 --> 00:59:52.260
I don't think that the young French people want that.
We should not try it on them.

00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:56.680
You can ask them to give some of their time, you can ask them to make sacrifices,

00:59:56.880 --> 00:59:59.340
you can ask them to have will—they are ready—

00:59:59.340 --> 01:00:04.320
but I refuse to try it on them by sumonning them to such improbable groupings.

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:09.280
This would be very badly received. As for me, I could of course explain our propositions.

01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:13.180
My conclusion will deal with Syria.

01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:23.700
I am happy that the proposition I have made from the very beginning was adopted by the UNO.

01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:25.980
Unanimously!

01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:39.300
So let me tell you that—not you, but my opponents, who have all been doing absurd overstatements in this domain,

01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:45.320
and who have made the situation incomprehensible, because it changes every week,

01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:48.300
with good guys becoming bad guys and vice versa,

01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:55.300
with those who were our enemies, who cruelly attacked us, becoming moderate rebels.

01:00:56.260 --> 01:01:00.980
Well it would have been easier to tackle problems the way I suggested we should tackle them.

01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:06.900
Since there is a problem with the transit of raw materials, then we should talk about it

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000
with those who have interests in this matter,

01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:15.800
and these are Turkey, Iran, Irak, Syria and other countries

01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:19.280
who are involved in this war by hiring various mercenaries.

01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:26.160
The only solution is to organize a lasting ceasefire through a universal coalition,

01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:32.240
and consequently everyone must participate, there cannot be two coalitions in one place

01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:36.200
that share and contend for enemies and allies.

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:45.340
And the only way to solve the political problem of Mr Bachar Al Assad's government is to organize elections.

01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:49.300
That's precisely what the UNO resolution says.

01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:55.000
I've been mocked for this because organizing elections in a country that went through such a war is difficult.

01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:57.840
All right. But what other choice do we have?

01:01:58.520 --> 01:01:59.380
None!

01:01:59.740 --> 01:02:02.220
None but carrying on with the war forever

01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:06.380
until one of the belligerents wins by destroying everyone else!

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.380
No one wants this solution.

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:15.600
François Hollande's absurd foreign policy went from failure to failure,

01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:17.800
and now we don't even take part in the discussions,

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:25.140
which is ironic for someone who claimed to solve problems with bombings.

01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:34.300
The issue of Syria once again poses the question of our autonomy and independence.

01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:39.720
I don't need to tell you why, you all have the answer in mind.

01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:44.760
Apparently, some things could not be done on our own.

01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:49.940
And earlier on, someone reminded us that when one cannot do something on his own any longer,

01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:56.580
it means the politics of others is being reinjected into our decision.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
The will to remain independent is therefore a whole.

01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:07.200
France's capacity to use its own military means and to equip its allies if need be,

01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:10.340
is of vital importance for the fatherland.

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:19.960
I want to denounce and point the finger at those who made the absurd decision of privatizing Nexter.

01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:29.580
They did this in absolutely loathsome conditions, since we now share the production of our tanks with a German family,

01:03:29.980 --> 01:03:35.340
and since the head office of this company was set in the Netherlands to better evade French and German taxes.

01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:41.400
This decision is shocking and unacceptable from start to finish.

01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:43.680
We will repeal this decision when the time comes.

01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:50.960
Similarly, buying weapons from others countries to equip the French armies—with decisive equipment particularly

01:03:51.140 --> 01:03:59.200
starting with the equipment of soldiers—is out of the question.

01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:09.280
I know that my political family is reluctant to deal with the issue of the production of arms.

01:04:10.060 --> 01:04:12.000
And I share the reasons why they feel reluctant to do this.

01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:18.500
But as was shown by Jean-Pierre Brat earlier on,

01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:28.220
we are capable of positionning the arms industry within the rest of the industry

01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:32.880
in a way that would enable us to not devote the arms industry to the sole production of arms.

01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:38.880
On the contrary, it could capitalize on the progress made in such and such domain.

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:46.100
In these conditions, I think that Jean-Pierre Brat's intervention was of the greatest importance.

01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:53.680
Primarily because when a union leader speaks, he speaks on behalf of the working class.

01:04:54.100 --> 01:05:01.020
It enables us to know what the workers in the arms industry think.

01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:10.700
Contrarily to what some might think, the employees of the arms industry are peacful, and sometimes even pacifists,

01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:15.940
and they are in favor of peace and disarmament.

01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:28.940
And I was happy to hear the account of Jean-Charles Hourcade, that followed Mr Goya's this morning.

01:05:29.900 --> 01:05:40.400
I hope you all understood how coherent, how clear and how strong our doctrine is.

01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:43.020
We've thought about for a long time,

01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:49.740
and when the time comes, I will not only be proud but capable of being Commander-in-Chief

01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:52.540
if it is the decision of the sovereign people.
