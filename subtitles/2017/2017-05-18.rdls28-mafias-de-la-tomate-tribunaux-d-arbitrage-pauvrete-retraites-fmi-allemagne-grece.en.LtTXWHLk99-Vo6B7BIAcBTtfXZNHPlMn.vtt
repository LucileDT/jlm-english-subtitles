00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.730
Hello, its the 28th edition of the Review Of The Week

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.260
And I'm recording it

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.740
from Marseille where I am at the moment.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.040
Well.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.200
Then let the intro roll.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.100
I am going to talk about a very important subject

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.360
because it will deeply affect the political life in the next months

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.640
in the European Union countries

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.000
Here is the question.. As you know there are free trade agreements

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.100
that have been signed between the European Union and one or another zone in the world.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:41.800
The legal discussion is whether such an agreement, after being signed by the European Union,

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.660
whether this agreement is within the jurisdiction of the sole European Union?

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.660
This would mean that the member states would not be involved.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.960
Or does it also depend of the states' jurisdictions?

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.500
In this case, the states should also sign one by one a free trade agreement

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.060
Do you follow? This is a very important matter because the European Commission

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.740
assumed that for a free trade agreement,

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:08.400
since the commerce falls within the European Union jurisprudence,

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.620
the individual states are not legally involved

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.820
But the Justice Court of the European Union has stated:

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.900
and it says: it is true that the commerce falls exclusively  within the Union jurisprudence.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.360
However, when within a free trade agreement there are particular arrangements

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:36.400
like setting up tribunals which judge conflicts between the states and the enterprises, or the enterprises and the states,

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.460
these famous tribunals of private arbitration,

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.600
then each state must speak up. Do you understand the importance of this matter?

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.000
Let me explain this again.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.900
Free trade agreements, from my point of view, are reprehensible,

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.560
because it is an illusion to believe that it suffices to move everything around to make the world better

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.200
and that this will develop human activity in a reasonable way.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.260
I don't believe that at all!

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.000
Let me not go further into that.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.900
What I want to bring to your attention is that these free trade agreements include the creation of these private arbitration tribunals.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.660
You have to understand that!

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.800
In the past, when a multinational company had a conflict with another one,

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.120
because there was no place to settle their differences because they are multinational

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.700
and because they could have conflicts within several countries

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.300
they had invented these tribunals of private arbitration.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.500
No problem, that's their business.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.900
That is to say, to sort out their disputes, and possibly their conflicts,

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.880
they used to convene a court with a magistrate, lawyers and so on

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:48.340
and the file was discussed. In this way, progressively came to be an international jurisprudence.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.020
And suddenly, the multinational companies, strong with their power, and the transnational companies

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.800
have decided to use the same system with the states

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.080
If we have a conflict with a state we will take it to an arbitration tribunal

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.120
Of course, this is not at all the same problem!

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:13.480
Because what matters for a country is the law, and everyone is subject to the law, including all companies.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:20.240
If you are in France, you are subject to the French law. But the multinational companies say "no, even in France we will not be subject to French law!"

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:27.840
"Every time we will have a conflict with the French government, we will go to the arbitration tribunal"

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:35.720
As a result there's no longer any need to draft laws, nor even to have a state, since the biggest players in the world's politics, the big companies,

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:42.000
could have their own court to make judgement, and all what you may decide does not count any more

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.300
But, wait! This is not just a matter of principle, you understand... Let me give you an example.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:54.500
If (as it has already happened), a state declares: smoking is very bad for your health, thus I make a law against smoking.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.260
—that's what happened in Australia—

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.200
the multinational company said: "you decide whatever you want at home with about cigarettes,

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.900
but because we have invested, and we expected to sell as many millions of cigarettes per year,

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.400
this being the reason for having made that investment,

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.900
this means you are making us lose money, which you now owe us."

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.300
They then organize a court case so that the Australian government pays for the cigarettes that the people have not smoked!

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.500
Even though the Australian government specifically wanted people not to smoke these cigarettes!

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.620
This is just one example.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.940
The same happened in Canada, with a petrol additive.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.920
They realized in Canada that it was clogging the engines and increasing pollution

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.000
"Maybe so", said the firm, "but nobody warned us that this product would be banned."

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.900
And they took the Canadian government to court, condemning it to pay a fine and to continue authorizing the sale of

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:46.100
this junk that pollutes the air and clogs the engines

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.360
Do you understand? This means that the national law no longer matters.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:05:01.100
And there is a perverse side to it. For example if you have a progressive government, or a humanist ecological and social government, like mine

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:08.980
Let's say we decide to have 100% organic produce at school cafeterias, and that all other produce are rejected.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:15.480
Then, you may have whichever company from the food industry saying: "What's this all about then?

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:22.120
We expected to sell – and were previously selling – however many thousands of these produce to local communities for the canteens

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:29.800
we disagree, our investment is in jeopardy. Thus the state owes us some money.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.400
It should compensate us by paying us for what we would have sold."

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:42.200
Then, what happens next? You think: "Dang, if I have to go to court and risk losing the case, I won't make such a decision in the first place."

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.160
As we are a big country, we can make the decisions we want.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.740
But imagine a country without sufficient power to contend with big multinational companies.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.160
You need to realize what are these multinational companies.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:58.400
There are multinational companies that have the same budget as that of several dozens countries!

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:02.300
How do you want those countries to make free decisions?

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.480
They can't any longer, they can't.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.500
Take the example of Surinam, in Amazonia.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:13.300
Imagine they say: we don't want the oil to be extracted here because it will make too much mess

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:22.260
then some experts will say: "But you are bound by previous authorizations, the big oil company that is settled in your country will take you to court."

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.020
You understand?

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.400
Thus this question of arbitration tribunals is paramount,

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.100
because there is no more democracy and the people have no power

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:36.280
if the multinational companies have the right to make their own tribunals to sort out their conflicts with the governments

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.080
and the governments cannot enforce the laws they want, that their people want

00:06:39.565 --> 00:06:43.900
as long as the multinationals are involved. You see the large question that is raised

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:49.500
Then the European Commission had stated: "This is not your business. We have solved the problem,

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:53.500
and concerning the free trade agreement with Canada, we have resolved the problem.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:57.700
A new kind of tribunal... private arbitrage... was put in place..."

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.340
That's what they say.

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:03.720
Thus, nobody has anything to say. It should be enforced. So you see, this is an important topic.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:11.360
Since the current government, that of Mr Macron is favorable to the free trade agreement with Canada

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:16.600
since he agrees with another free trade agreement with Asia

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:22.540
thus, for them all was well, they just has to say "It's all decided already, the European Commission said that we don't have any word in the matter."

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:25.580
On the contrary! Now France must have its say,

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.460
either by a vote at the Assembly, or by referendum.

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:34.040
And so too for all the other European Union states. Now, firstly this will take time

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:39.200
secondly, as we are dealing with the European Union and that such a decision can only be taken unanimously

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.000
everyone in Europe has to agree

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:47.020
It bears without saying that this is going to change the atmosphere.

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:52.420
Thus president Macron will have to present to the vote of the new Assembly

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:59.200
the free trade agreements with Asia and with Canada, and possibly also with the USA.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:04.300
With this in mind, you need to understand that there will be two types of deputies in the Assembly:

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:09.400
Those who agree to private –
 or near-private – arbitration tribunals,

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:15.400
which is to say the whole majority coalition, some socialists (they already said that they agreed)

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:20.460
some members of the Republican party, for them as long as business is concerned they're down

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:21.620
and some centrists

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.000
and, on the other side, there will be us, and only us,

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:28.560
because we are the only ones to be against the private arbitration tribunals,

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:33.500
we "La France Insoumise", as well as our various allies in the group that we will form in the National Assembly.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:39.440
OK? Think about it, people, even if this is complicated and difficult to explain around you

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:43.560
it is of very great importance because at stake is democracy itself.

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:48.500
If, from now on, there is the law for everyone and on the other side another law for multinational companies,

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:50.640
you see that we are no longer living in the same world...

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:54.100
Let me now begin to talk about poverty.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:00.855
Poverty is starting to take over Europe, increasingly strongly and at all levels.

00:09:00.855 --> 00:09:03.535
When I say "at all levels", here is what I mean.

00:09:03.645 --> 00:09:12.400
Some people suppose that you become poor by starting with a medium wage, then a low wage, and then, wham, you've become poor.

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.500
No no no. Poverty hits at all levels.

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:15.200
This means...

00:09:15.705 --> 00:09:22.700
You might be in a certain category, where you have highly skilled job, with a commensurate lifestyle, etc...

00:09:23.545 --> 00:09:28.800
Now imagine you get wiped out, you lose your job for some reason or other,

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:32.000
and at that point you suddenly no longer have anything.

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:39.800
Indeed, all of a sudden, you no longer have any income, yet you still have the bills commensurate with your previous income:

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:44.300
maybe a big house, an expensive car, all of that... you have to sell it all, you have to throw it all out the window.

00:09:44.425 --> 00:09:53.000
This is just an example, but of course,  you more easily wind up poor starting from the middle class or the working class.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:58.045
The step between a real wage and poverty is actually surprisingly small.

00:09:58.045 --> 00:10:05.300
You know that just about 150€ separates the (official) poverty line from minimum wage.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.500
Few people know this. But it's a tiny step!

00:10:08.845 --> 00:10:11.675
Indeed, with only 1000€, in France, we are below the poverty line

00:10:11.675 --> 00:10:13.400
– according to international organisations –

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:17.500
but 1000€ is already a lot, for many people, who have tiny tiny retirement pensions.

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:21.065
So that's what brings me to the topic of poverty.

00:10:22.265 --> 00:10:25.325
Something quite extraordinary has indeed happened. The IMF –

00:10:25.325 --> 00:10:29.600
the International Monetary Fund, a large global institution,

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.300
which monitors

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:33.800
(essentially to the benefit of the USA, its main shareholder)

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.900
which monitors the state of the world's economies.

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:38.500
The president of this whole thing is Mme Christine Lagarde

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:43.800
This organisation sometimes lends money to various states and then proceeds to dictate policy decisions.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.365
When you fall into the claws of the IMF, usually, it's over, you can close down.

00:10:48.365 --> 00:10:51.000
There's no political power left, the IMF makes all the decisions for you.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:58.735
The FMI said that there is a problem of developing poverty in the richest country of the European Union: Germany.

00:10:59.415 --> 00:11:00.900
It's interesting to try to understand this.

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:03.600
Firstly, it tells us what the so-called "German model" is worth,

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:06.895
to all those who played you the violin on this topic,

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:12.500
to such an extent that I wrote a little book on the subject, called "Le Hareng De Bismarck" (Bismarck's Herring).
(NB: 'Herring' refers to a French expression according to which the truth always eventually surfaces.)

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:16.460
In this book, I took apart line by line all the "great examples" of German success,

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:18.100
and I showed that it was all completely phoney.

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:21.560
Indeed, I showed that Germany's economy was fragile,

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:24.000
very concentrated in certain domains of activity,

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:27.260
and that it creates an incredible number of poor and underpaid people,

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:28.960
to an absolutely unique extent in Europe.

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:34.540
So now, the IMF itself is saying that it can't go on any longer,

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:40.660
because the risk of increased poverty, of extreme poverty, in Germany, is too considerable.

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:44.440
So you must then understand that this is all linked to economic policy.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:48.920
Meanwhile, Germany keeps exporting its own political model.

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:49.760
You know,

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:54.080
it is the Germans who were the harshest to the Greeks.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:57.920
So Hollande at the time was the "good cop",

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:02.720
so that while Dr Schäuble and Mme Merkel were belting Mr Tsipras,

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:06.460
Hollande was saying "let me help me help you", and other phrases of the sort,

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:09.035
to make him swallow the bill to sign.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:12.720
So then Tsipras indeed signed, the height of stupidity.

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:15.740
He said "Well I'm going to...", you know, the usual spiel.

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:18.080
"I'm going to change things from the inside."

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.900
So of course all the journalists came onto me, telling me:

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:23.560
"Your friend Tsipras has a more reasonable attitude than you do."

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:25.700
"Look, he's going to make the necessary efforts."

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.000
"He's going to change it from within." etc

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.400
Outcome? We're even worse off than when we started.

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:34.500
That is to stay, it changed absolutely nothing to the situation in Greece,

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:38.080
and they already had to swallow two additional plans.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:41.480
We no longer dare to say that these were "de rigueur" (necessary), as this time they're down to scraping the bone.

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:44.640
And now, yet another plan is about to be applied.

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.560
Pay close attention to how it goes down.

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:49.600
It's interesting to see how these people operate,

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:53.140
because they then proceed to apply the same method in all the other countries.

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:57.240
You just say "Well it's just austerity."
No, it's more cunning than that!

00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:01.580
They unravel the sweater from the loose thread hanging out,

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:04.280
parts of the population which they see as defenseless.

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:07.980
Of course, top of their list of targets are the retired people.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:12.960
This is because, at the outset, retired people have less charges than others.

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:17.340
They might own their apartment, or might have resided in the same place for long enough,

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:21.920
so that their rent remained level,

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:25.760
and hasn't increased as violently as if the lease had been renewed,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.280
or whatever else have you. Anyway.

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.700
Retired people tend also to already be equipped,

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:35.200
so they have less of a need to invest into every day life than a young couple might.

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.820
So, when retired people withstand the first blows,

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:41.600
well, of course, they are unhappy about it.

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.520
But they rationalise it.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:46.860
They tell themselves "Well, we've known worse. We've been more miserable than this."

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:49.920
"If it's to the benefit of the young people, it's not so bad..."

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:51.380
"We're willing to make sacrifices..."

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:55.280
After that, from sacrifice to sacrifice, we pare off everything they have.

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.400
This is exactly what happened in Greece.

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:02.860
Now they hit, they hit, they hit, and they keep hitting the retired people.

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:05.020
So the retirees suffer.

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.940
They commit suicide.

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:11.340
They live an awful life.

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:13.340
So then, well, they rebel.

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:18.240
But then, look in France. Where does Macron's government start? With the retirees.

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:22.640
He says that the taxpayer will no longer contribute to unemployment benefits through payroll taxes.

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:25.220
But then, who pays?

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:29.980
With or without these payroll contributions, the unemployment benefits still remain, as one should well hope,

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:35.400
even though they intend to monitor more closely the unemployed, as to them they're but a bunch of dodgers.

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:39.100
Nevertheless, we still have to pay for these benefits.

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:42.520
OK, maybe only half of the unemployed receive benefits, but it's still there.

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:43.980
So we still have to pay this.

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:53.620
By law, every euro of social contributions (payroll tax) exonerated has to then be found in the state's budget.

00:14:54.300 --> 00:15:02.040
Where then does Mr Macron hope to find the money to compensate these social contributions towards unemployment, which will no longer be paid through the companies?

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:04.400
The CSG ("Contribution Sociale Généralisée", Generalized Social Contribution)

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:06.420
But then, who pays the CSG?

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:10.360
In part, the retirees.
So you see the absurdity of the situation.

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:17.500
Retirees will end up contributing to the CSG, to compensate the payroll tax cuts, towards unemployment benefits.

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:21.860
But according to the system of social insurance, we give according to our ability, and receive according to our needs.

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:23.440
In the face of a risk!

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.180
A risk which we protect ourselves from through this insurance.

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:25.880
You follow?

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.360
It's social insurance.

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:32.280
But tell me now: retirees aren't at risk from unemployment; they are retired.

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:37.700
So we're making them contribute, in an indirect manner, for something they aren't at risk of.

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:40.220
It's thus indeed a tax.

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:48.020
And it's indeed a tax which will take from the less privileged.

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:50.380
You see, the policies are consistent.

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:54.840
Poverty is the evil that is taking over society,

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:57.280
and is the sign of society's total failure

00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:00.980
"The great and beautiful liberal model"
blahblahblah 
"it all works"

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:05.080
"Everyone's happy"
"We buy a new smartphone every six months"

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.000
etc etc

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:07.480
A total invention.

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:11.420
In their daily life, a greater and greater amount of people are suffering.

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:14.300
And it's the weakest that the system attacks.

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:16.080
Nibble, nibble, nibble, nibble.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:19.020
All that for what, I wonder?

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:21.980
At the end, we all live in the same society.

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:26.220
Do the rich figure they can close themselves off, barricade themselves off – they try, eh? –

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:28.880
and keep ignoring what happens in the rest of society.

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:31.620
They will unleash a terrible violence within it.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.460
All of this will come to be settled in the upcoming legislative elections.

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:39.320
But above all, I want everyone to understand

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.140
Is that our opponent

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:42.940
financial capitalism

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:46.840
has a clear strategy. It has its politicians, and its media puppets,

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:49.360
but it does have a strategy. It doesn't shoot blindly.

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.740
It finds an end and takes it from there.

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:56.460
It always starts from the same side: devastating social protection systems,

00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:59.000
where we mutually protect each other,

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:01.980
to force everyone into a battle of each against all.

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:06.140
Now I'm going to tell you about something that might seem off-the-wall,

00:17:06.585 --> 00:17:09.135
but yet, I find it so meaningful.

00:17:10.425 --> 00:17:11.705
Here's the deal.

00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:14.180
... the tomato.

00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:17.700
Everyone eats tomatoes. You didn't realise? Yes indeed.

00:17:18.085 --> 00:17:20.805
We eat, on average, 5.5kg of tomatoes every year.

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.260
Individually.

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:23.320
So you see.

00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:26.580
We consume a lot.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.980
So we have to produce them, and we have to sell them.

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:30.060
So of course...

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:33.440
how do we produce, how do we sell, under liberal logic?

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:39.180
The place where we can pay people the least to pick the tomatoes, that's where we put the tomatoes.

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:43.460
And we use a particular strain of tomatoes, those suitable to be turned into concentrates.

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:50.220
You know, when you prepare pasta, or whatever else which needs tomato sauce,

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.780
pay attention to where the sauce comes from, as written on the packaging.

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:59.080
You'll see that they often come from very, very far.

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:03.120
What will probably surprise you is that these tomatoes aren't like the usual tomatoes you know.

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:04.320
They grow underground.

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:05.980
And they have a thicker skin.

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:10.095
It's with these tomatoes that we produce tomato juice in industrial quantities.

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:12.300
And whereabouts might these be produced? In China, of course!

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:18.140
Because over there, we can find people who will pick these tomatoes for peanuts.

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:23.640
So you have a stream of tomatoes, made into a sauce, incoming from China.

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:26.500
So this stream arrives, well, it arrives in Europe.

00:18:27.255 --> 00:18:29.865
It arrives in Italy. Well guess who takes charge? 
The mafia.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000
Of course.

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:38.240
The mafia then recirculates this sauce, making an extraordinary profit off the back of these large quantities of tomatoes from China.

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:40.360
A book was written on this matter.

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:45.720
It describes the involvement of the mafia in the world's consumption of tomatoes.

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.795
It's called "L'Empire De L'Or Rouge" (The Empire of Red Gold)

00:18:48.795 --> 00:18:51.585
Global study of today's tomato.

00:18:51.725 --> 00:18:52.725
But.

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:55.260
This too encourages reflection.

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:58.080
How can we have a tomato mafia?

00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.740
Tomatoes, after all...

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:03.480
Never would you have thought that there would be such political stakes,

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:06.180
such economic stakes, with these poor tomatoes.

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:08.500
This is because we started off with the idea

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:11.600
that relocating the whole world was the ordinary approach.

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:16.960
If we started from the idea that, as France can produce tomatoes, it can produce tomatoes for itself.

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:18.260
Period.

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:22.000
And the Spanish produce tomatoes for themselves, and the Portuguese produce tomatoes for themselves.

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:24.500
So you say: "But what of the countries where tomatoes can't grow?"

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:26.720
Sweden, Norway...

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:28.045
To be seen. Nevertheless...

00:19:28.045 --> 00:19:29.980
we'll ask what quantities are needed.

00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:32.160
That's called solidary protectionism.

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:38.160
We make our own tomatoes, and we make enough for the needs of others who can't produce their own.

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:39.440
But not

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:44.740
when any one has the opportunity to produce industrial quantities of tomatoes

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:50.460
... and produce in the greatest quantities possible at the lowest possible price to squash all producers of tomatoes elsewhere.

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:52.120
Well that, that is the liberal logic.

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:59.600
So you see, when you think about tomato juice, or of the tomato concentrate that you put in your pasta

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:04.180
you find political stakes.
So you'll view your pasta differently next time, no? So.

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:08.860
I hope you enjoyed.
You see, I didn't talk about political news.

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:10.960
I've got other places to do that.

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:14.400
Sometimes I make little movies, little videos

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:18.440
Or I talk about it here or there, and we put that up for you to watch.

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:22.840
So I wanted to... as you say, "sanctuarise" the weekly review,

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:27.960
so that we could talk about thought-provoking subjects, rooted in every day life.

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:32.980
Topics where we can see the link between our thoughts about the world, economy, and politics.

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:38.760
Rather than things that are strictly to do with electoral campaigns, in which I of course participate.

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:39.980
There you have it.

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:43.540
If you liked this review, please give it a little blue thumb.

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:49.960
It helps us rise up in the rankings, and it assists in the diffusion of this YouTube channel,

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:56.760
which is already a very impressive thing, as we draw near to 400k subscribers.

00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:02.680
If you want us to reach that milestone, you just need to subscribe.

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:07.760
There it is. Thank you for the attention you have given this little video.
