00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.300
Emmanuel Macron was elected
president of the Republic on Sunday.

00:00:03.601 --> 00:00:06.668
You saw him at the Louvre.
What did you think about this evening...

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.233
...with Emmanuel Macron wanting to make
his speech in front of the pyramid?

00:00:10.534 --> 00:00:12.734
Quite frankly,
what did you think of this?

00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:15.266
That's his style. I certainly
wouldn't have done that.

00:00:15.667 --> 00:00:18.101
It's monarchist
and choosing the Louvre...

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.901
...which is one of the symbols
of the French monarchy.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.001
This peculiar atmosphere with the pyramid,
itself a monarchist symbol.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.760
That's his temperment,
that's how he is.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.140
-It's important.
-What will remain is...

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.760
...this monarchist image he wanted
to create for himself...

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:35.367
...which corresponds to his obligations -
It must be said, Mr. Bourdin...

00:00:35.634 --> 00:00:37.301
...because he doesn't have
a majority.

00:00:37.634 --> 00:00:42.034
So he must be the most Cesarean
president we've ever known because...

00:00:42.334 --> 00:00:46.334
...he plans to implement his program,
we won't hold it against him.

00:00:46.667 --> 00:00:49.635
He believes in his ideas but it'll be
hard with no majority to...

00:00:50.067 --> 00:00:52.067
...attack the Labor Law,
for example.

00:00:52.267 --> 00:00:54.534
I respect his job.
I want to say that.

00:00:54.767 --> 00:00:56.867
I won't haggle over
his getting elected.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.801
I wish him well in carrying out
his mission.

00:01:00.033 --> 00:01:03.667
I wish him good health,
essential for what he has to do.

00:01:03.868 --> 00:01:06.935
And naturally, I'll be fighting
him relentlessly...

00:01:07.167 --> 00:01:10.167
...by placing myself as leader-
if the voters agree -

00:01:10.455 --> 00:01:13.689
...of a coalition government
if we can achieve that.

00:01:13.968 --> 00:01:17.535
The first condition is for
the 7 million people...

00:01:17.667 --> 00:01:19.234
...who voted for
"L'Avenir en commun"...

00:01:19.601 --> 00:01:21.668
...hold true
to that commitment.

00:01:21.934 --> 00:01:24.268
It's a program,
not "Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon", the person.

00:01:24.567 --> 00:01:27.700
At all my speeches, you heard me
stopping people from yelling my name.

00:01:27.834 --> 00:01:29.735
Don't yell my name!

00:01:29.901 --> 00:01:31.368
I said we yell "resistance".

00:01:31.701 --> 00:01:35.035
We yell "resistance"!
We yell "rebellious"!

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.634
We support a program.

00:01:36.868 --> 00:01:39.502
I firmly believe in putting
the program at the center.

00:01:39.734 --> 00:01:43.034
So, along with my friends,
I'm running in the legislative elections.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.834
We have a program and
we're ready to govern.

00:01:46.033 --> 00:01:49.267
I'm starting a campaign
to win.

00:01:49.601 --> 00:01:53.734
Meaning, when I see the polls,
I'm between 13 or 16%.

00:01:53.968 --> 00:01:57.335
And Mr. Macron between 20 and 24.
That's nothing!

00:01:57.434 --> 00:01:59.135
6 points is easy
to make up!

00:01:59.501 --> 00:02:02.935
We could have a legislative majority!
I'm fighting for that!

00:02:03.267 --> 00:02:06.434
This is about our program,
"L'Avenir en Commun".

00:02:06.667 --> 00:02:09.001
Don't give Mr. Macron
full power!

00:02:09.234 --> 00:02:11.901
Vote for "La France Insoumise"
candidates!
