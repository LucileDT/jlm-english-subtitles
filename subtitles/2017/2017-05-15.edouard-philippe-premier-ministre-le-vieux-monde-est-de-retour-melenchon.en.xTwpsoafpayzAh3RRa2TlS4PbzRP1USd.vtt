00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.420
«Ladies and gentlemen

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:08.940
the new president has just taken command of our country's entire traditional political class

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.000
the old world is back

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.740
under young and brand new clothes

00:00:14.875 --> 00:00:17.375
the right party just became affiliated

00:00:17.375 --> 00:00:20.825
with a prime minister coming from their line, the republicans

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.740
the socialist party was already absorbed

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.020
since plenty of their elected officials and candidates

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.240
asked for the investiture of Mr Macron and many of them

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.860
are waiting to be elected, to join him.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.020
Finally,

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.320
The far right's electorates

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.820
after this party did the scarecrow job we expected them to

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.620
The electorates of the alt rights party are abandoned

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.660
Their leaders are all gone.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.940
So that now, next to Mr Macron, and for the sake of our democracy,

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.480
the only force that will remain is strong, consistent and united

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.680
around one governmental program, "L'avenir en commun" /Mélenchon's program/

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.020
It's "la France Insoumise" of which I am the spokesperson

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:05.880
and it's this party that tells French people

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.360
Do not give the full power to Emmanuel Macron and his prime minister

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.920
a cohabitation is necessary

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.140
which means we have to form a majority that is different from the current President,

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.680
from his odds and ends

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.760
So we can have a consistent political action

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.000
that answers expectations that are, social, ecological and democratic for our people.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.480
These hazardous hitches

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.940
that were just formed will only work for the price

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.300
of a dictatorship and authoritarianism from the presidencial monarchy that keeps growing.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.980
He is,

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.880
therefore,

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.300
dangerous for the future of our country

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.740
Do not give the full power to Mr Macron

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.820
Allow our country to have an alternative

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.440
Gather together, with us, to our call.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.500
May all of your voting paper act as a broom to wipe them all away»
