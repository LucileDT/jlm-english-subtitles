00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.060
Tonight marks the end of the most calamitous presidency of the 5th Republic

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.500
that destroyed virtually all the trust people had in it.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.560
But once again, in spite of everything,

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.080
through abstention, blank and spoilt ballots,

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.500
as well as through the votes for Mr. Macron

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.920
our country massively rejected the far right

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.320
because it is unfamiliar to the Republican identity of France.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.540
Mrs Le Pen came third of the second round

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.440
after Mr Macron, and after abstention, blank and spoilt ballots.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.680
We have a new president.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.060
Courtesy and the love for our democracy

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.220
commands that we accept it without any hesitation

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.160
and that we send him our best wishes.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.120
May the sense of our homeland's destiny possess you Mr President.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.560
May you be obsessed by the poor, those who have no rights, the homeless and the unemployed.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:05.020
May France benefit from your victory, although we had better make sure it will by ourselves.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.480
We know the program of the new presidential monarch.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.880
It is war against the social achievements of the country and ecological irresponsibility.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.540
It is not inevitable.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.980
The general election must show that, after a vote of rejection and fear,

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.200
the time has come for a positive choice: the choice for "Our Common Future".

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:37.340
I call on the seven million people who voted for the project of which I was the candidate

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.340
to mobilize and remain united whether they voted for Mr Macron, or not.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:52.200
I call on all those who are ready to break with the past to join La France Insoumise,

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.120
that became the new mass movement thanks to our efforts,

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.780
a movement that came in the lead in so many cities of our country.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.160
Federate, people!

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:09.480
Don't scatter, because you saw that you were eliminated from the presidential runoff for a difference of 600k votes.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.300
Federate, if you identify yourselves with ecological and social humanism,

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.240
which is necessary for our time and for which I try to be the spokesman.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.300
Don't let go people, don't give up!

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:33.040
[Cut] This country and its inhabitants are not condemned to either the power of the rich or that of haters.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.000
A new parliamentary majority is possible around La France Insoumise.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.400
The taste for happiness remains contagious.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.840
If you answer our call on June 18th— the day the second round of legislative—

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.100
our resistance can win the battle!

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.940
And, together with you, I will work towards it with all my energy.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.460
Long live the Republic! Long live France!
