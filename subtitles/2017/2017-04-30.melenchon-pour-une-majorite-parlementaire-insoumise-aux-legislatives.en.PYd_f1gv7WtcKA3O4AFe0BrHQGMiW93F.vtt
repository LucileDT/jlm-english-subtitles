00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.100
Good evening Jean-Luc Mélenchon

00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:01.600
Good evening

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.420
Thank you very much for accepting our invitation

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.420
Thanks for inviting me

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.020
This is your first interview since the first round of the election

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.480
last sunday night, you seemed to have had a hard time accepting the results and your fourth position

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.980
No, I waited for the results to be confirmed

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:16.920
because

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.800
as you could see, the results ended up being more close than we first thought

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.040
and, it is completely normal to wait for confirmed results before commenting them

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.040
especially since the three of us(candidates) gathered about seven millions votes each

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.260
I personally was 600,000 votes away from reaching the second round

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.540
600,000 more votes and we wouldn't be in this situation tonight

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.480
We'd have a duel between mister Marcron and Myself

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.500
Therefore, I was right to take some time before making a statement

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:42.820
and then

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:48.300
I made a declaration, maybe without realizing the strength of the political force that was gathered behind me, 7 million votes

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.800
but most of all, leading in dozens of cities, towns and villages and in the biggest cities of the country

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.600
which gives ma as of now

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.920
a great responsibility, I cannot be the same man anymore

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.900
I now represent this political force and I know that the results of these elections

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.400
from the first round or the second round cannot and will not provide any stability for this country

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.980
the two candidates left in the race only represent 45% of the voting population

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.180
and a massive amount of people abstained from voting again

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.860
may I remind you, 10 million people last time!

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.320
so, the real political event, the one that will confirm the political future of the country

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.840
will be the upcoming parliamentary elections

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.840
which is why, I will take part in it myself

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:33.560
and lead this new political force in order to get a majority of the seats in the parliament

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.680
before the parliamentary elections, there is a second and you'll have to choose

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.720
back in 2002 you didn't hesitate, we heard it, to vote for J.Chirac

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.220
yes

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.720
why aren't you doing the same this time a round, is Marine LePen different from J.M.LePen?

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.440
Yes it' all the same...

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.660
So why aren't calling for a vote against her?

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.460
Don't worry I'm going to give you a very clear answer

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.460
first of all, there is no ambiguity in what I'm saying, I'm not saying...

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.180
You're saying you won't tell us who you're voting for

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.180
I'm not saying : "neither..nor..."

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.100
ok?

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.300
I won't vote for Marine LePen, I've always fought against her ideas

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.300
and I'm telling everyone listening to me

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.660
do not make the horrible mistake of voting for her

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.860
because you would throw the country into a chaos that wouldn't end in the foreseeable future

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:20.200
because she would put us into a state of war where everyone would look at each other, wondering who is really french and who isn't

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.200
what religion this one or that one has, etc

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.200
so, please don't do it

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.000
but

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.200
since 2002 something has happened, because in 2002 everyone thought it was an accident

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:36.240
but now every single elections is done under the threat of a second round where the far right is present

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.340
and they try to scare us and make vote for something we don't wan't

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.340
well, let me tell you,

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.060
everyone forgot that after the regional elections, I acted the same way

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.900
I didn't call for a united vote against them

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.300
because this "Republican front" is basically asking people who started a fire to extinguish it

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.980
I have nothing in common with the LR party or with the Socialist party

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.880
in terms of political goals, therefore

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.920
I'm telling everyone to use their intelligence

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.380
make sure to know what you have to do, because only you can decide what to do

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.120
why am I saying this?

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.620
because my own electors have three different intentions, just like during the regional elections

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.740
those that will vote for Macron, and I respect their decision

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.360
those that want to abstain from voting, I respect them too

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.360
and those who want to vote "none of the above"

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.360
and my duty is to tell them

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.360
no matter what you did

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.880
you have me to lean on, me and my movement

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.800
and I'm ready to govern this country if we obtain a majority in the parliament

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.940
sorry for asking again but, are you ready to vote "none of the above"?

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:32.600
wait

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.500
since you're not saying who you'll vote for but you won't vote for LePen

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.000
do you plan on voting "none of the above"?

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
it's my own business and I won't tell you

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.900
aren't you afraid of...

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:56.580
aren't you afraid of giving LePen an advantage by encouraging people not to vote?

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.140
what's helping Madame LePen is voting for her

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:00.780
wasn't I clear enough?

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.780
I said : don't vote for her

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.480
I won't do more than that because it would divide my electors

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:14.440
and I'd like to tell Mr. Macron that he shouldn't have talked down to me for asking the members of my movement what we should do next

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.440
because instead of trying to convince them, he tried to threaten them into supporting him

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.960
first by insulting me, which isn't very clever if you want the votes of my electors...

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.800
and secondly by calling them irresponsible

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.340
so my duty is to try to convince my friends to act according to their conscience

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.700
because let me tell you something

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.460
I am certain that among those seven million people

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.880
only a small fraction would ever vote for LePen

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.880
and I'm telling them : you're making a mistake

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.640
and all the others will either not vote, vote "none of the above" or vote for Macron

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.000
And I respect their decision

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.360
I speak in their name, they don't expect me to tell them what they should do

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.360
besides not voting for the far right!

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.140
Your silence is quite surprising because Marine LePen

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:04.500
has been using your vocabulary this week

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.880
she tried to reach out to your electorate

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.360
indeed

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.180
and yet you remain silent

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.180
doesn't that bother you?

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.500
-How stupid do you think the French people are?

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.820
Do you think they're incapable of realizing that this is just an act?

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.820
That's not the first time this happens, François Hollande did the same thing

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.940
He promised to renegotiate the European treaties and stand up to the banks.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:31.560
He was fluent in Melenchon, no one needed a dictionary to translate

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.860
and he was lying, people could tell

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.860
but they wanted to get rid of Mr. Sarkozy

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.480
this time around, everyone can tell she's copying me

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:43.140
but many journalists and commentators kept repeating we were the same

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:47.200
now it's their job to show the contrary

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.060
Now I want to repeat what truly matters

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:54.300
I know for a fact that everything will be decided during the parliamentary elections

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:59.540
So here's what I have to say : I think France will get rid of M. LePen at the second round

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.540
but a month from now

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.200
We'll get rid of Mr.Macron project for the country

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.500
because it would also be a horrible mistake to let him govern

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:15.360
because this man won't do anything other than deeply socially divide this country

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.940
but for now we need to move a step at a time

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.940
and those who support me must remain together

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.940
-will you run for parliament?

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:27.520
-we're thinking about it, thanks for asking

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.520
We'll see if I should personally run

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:36.800
is it the best way to lead the fight or is it better to stay behind, like a general on hill?

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.460
but if I do run, I'll wait for signals to decide where I should run

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.460
Maybe Marseille or Toulouse

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:47.780
as you know in Marseille, my movement is leading

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.300
what a beautiful symbol

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.300
it was said that this city had surrendered itself to the far right

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:52.460
well it isn't true

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:55.900
so, either Marseille, Toulouse or maybe Lille

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.800
there are several cities where I could run

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.800
we're discussing it, but what is certain is that

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.360
I need to be heard, the game isn't over

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:10.660
Our movement and its allies are running to govern the country

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:15.540
because getting elected president isn't enough, you need a majority in the parliament to govern

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:20.360
-as we said, you have obtained one in every five votes last Sunday

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:30.660
Do you plan on becoming more than a mere MP, do you plan on leading the opposition? Do you see yourself as the new leader of the left?

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:49.680
Considering the new strength of my movement, it is now my role to lead and gather people around me and my project for the country.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.920
Pardon my audacity

00:07:53.920 --> 00:08:00.400
but I remained persuaded that, considering how weak the remaining two candidates are

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:05.320
and considering their inability to unite the country,

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:09.360
I can win the parliamentary elections

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.840
So yes, I do see myself a the leader of a new coalition that is a majority in this country

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:15.680
-Do you wish to be Macron's prime minister?

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.680
-Well he'll have to get used to it!

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.680
-So you see yourself in this role.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:24.020
-I'd like to give him some advice before leaving, because I must at least be somewhat useful in this race...

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:28.300
Instead of insulting me, instead of twisting our arms

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.300
why doesn't he, for example, throw us a bone?

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:34.420
Even LePen is trying to talk to my electors...

00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:36.420
So why doesn't he?

00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:39.880
He could say "I understand you", as he often says

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:43.320
"I give up on my idea to reform the worker's protections code"

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.320
"I set it aside"

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.760
So you could come to me

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.760
Mr.Macron you have to do something!

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.340
You can't just ask us to vote for you and support your project

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:54.340
no, we don't agree with you

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:57.360
he's acting irresponsibly

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.360
-So  we have understood that you're sending a message to E.Macron tonight. thank you for accepting our invitation.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.800
-thank you
