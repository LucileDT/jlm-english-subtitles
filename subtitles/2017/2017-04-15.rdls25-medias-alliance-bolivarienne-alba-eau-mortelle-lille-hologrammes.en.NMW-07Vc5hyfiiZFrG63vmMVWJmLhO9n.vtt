00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:08.560
Hello! This is the 25th edition of the weekly review and the penultimate one before the first ballot of the presidential elections

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:16.140
and because of this we could say that two weekly reviews from now the world will have changed.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:25.420
So first off, you know the rules: you put likes as much as you can so the video goes up if you liked it.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:32.620
We went over 20 million views on this youtube channel

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:38.820
and we hope to reach 300 000 subscribers before the first ballot of the presidential election.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.420
It should be possible as we are already a little bit more than 280 000.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.280
For this 25th edition, let's start with the credits.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.800
I'll start with a subject that has to do with the somewhat drab atmosphere

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.400
that some people are trying to put around me, because they need to defend themselves.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:09.540
Because they don't want me to become president at all, or even to see me reach the second ballot,

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.260
since a few days, they're launching an offensive.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.920
It's normal in a democracy that we fight over who gets the votes, it's normal,

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.780
it's actually what the election is about; it's to convince people that a thing is good and another thing isn't.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.600
Where it gets strange is when the campaign becomes totally made up.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:40.240
So there is a list of people that decided to launch a campaign on the theme "Mélenchon, Chavez, Fidel Castro, Putin"

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:46.040
I think that they must encourage each other in it because everyone of them keeps bringing new things

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.620
and make things up. It's a bit ridiculous.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.920
So they talk about Castro: he's dead; they talk to me about Hugo Chavez; he's dead.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.200
So we're talking about people that are not there

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.460
And all of this to induce the idea that I crave to become a dictator

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.000
and this people persuade themselves and from one to the other they keep making things up, adding things.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.980
I have here a newspaper that is particularly vile in its hostility

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.140
because after all, they call themselves leftists at the Obs.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.160
They could at least respect me

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.360
they could argue with me by saying "Well, we disagree with him" but why do they do that?

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.480
"Mélenchon or the Kremlin Peace"

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.440
you see, those people that have strong bonds to the United States of America, we'll say that,

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.220
doing a title like that on me, "The Kremlin Peace".

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.720
Why do they believe in this? Of course it ends with...

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.760
Everything that I say is put to end up with:

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.240
Mélenchon said: "We don't want any war, be it little, medium or big, on this continent."

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.760
to add right after it: "A little bit like Chamberlain and Daladier at Munich!"

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.260
Munich! It's always Munich their thing,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.720
that is to say the idea of a capitulation, that by the way, allows them to compare Putin to Hitler.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.200
And it doesn't even bother them, to them everything is the same,

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:07.240
et below that there's a guy nammed Serge Raffy writing a paper on me.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.220
So, it is written "Mélenchon or the quiet guerrillero" in red

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.360
because you're too stupid, if it's not written in red you don't understand

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.940
that it's to say that I'm a red and it's start like that

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.440
- I'll just read you the first sentence because it made me laugh-

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.320
"Call him "El Chon" and he shivers in satisfaction"

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.260
and he adds 'Compare him with the Che who died in Bolivia

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.780
driven by the crazy dream of an impossible Bolivarian revolution, and he won't argue with that."

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:42.440
So there are several things that this Serge Raffy ignores: first off, the Che's project wasn't the Bolivarian revolution,

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.480
this is Chavez, something like 40 years later.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:52.740
No, it was a socialist revolution and if he knows a little bit about my past,

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.940
there are people that are interested in knowing what I thought about those things when it came up,

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:03.180
I have never been a supporter of the guerilla as described by the Che,

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.500
that the Che put in practice for reasons that I won't touch on now

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:13.620
because those are old arguments that are now outdaded and the rest is just the same.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.980
I am nostalgic of dictatorship because I love that, I love tyrans,

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.380
and this is what this guy is telling in his papers.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:26.800
But to read that you, maybe you're, you're a liberal intellectual, from a certain left,

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.240
intellectual, quiet, your thing isn't political strategy or anythingn

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:39.040
but anyway, you're from this political family, so you give 3,90 €, you buy a newspaper and they say to you:

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:44.460
"Are you Macron, Mélenchon or Hamon?", for exemple. Plus the photos on the cover are cool.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.780
So you say to yourself "I'd like to know, I'll try to check that up"

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.520
so you have a quiz, and here again in this quiz...

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.760
If you put a little red triangle, you're agreeing with me,

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.680
and rest assured that any time that you choose the little red triangle

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:10.460
you'll fall on Cuba, or I don't what, Venezuela, Putin...

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:16.440
This morning, it was... They found their angle, here it is, and it rocks!

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.960
They found in my program that I think that France should join the ALBA,

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:28.680
The ALBA! So you're home and you're like what's that? What is that, what happened at the ALBA?

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.500
Naturally nobody knows what the ALBA is, or very few people know.

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.180
We can learn about that by ourselves but you count on journalists to do it for you, don't you?

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:44.360
Well, you're out of luck. So they say the ALBA is a Chavez invention, so we already know that it's not worth arguing about it

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:53.060
and then they say yes, but in the ALBA there is Venezuela, and also Russia and Iran as observers,

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:59.920
not very democratic. So, we should start from the beginning. So first, what is the ALBA?

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:04.860
It's organisation based on cooperation in the latino-america continent.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:11.560
It's the only association based on cooperation, that is to say not aimed at profit making.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:17.800
It isn't a single market thing like Mercosur, or a market coalition

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:24.920
like the Andean Community - the CAN -, it isn't the pacific treaty.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:33.060
It isn't any of these things it is something that is aimed at cooperation in any area where we can cooperate.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.940
So no trading relationships... I mean, it can be commercial relationships,

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:41.440
but if they're trading relationships, then they're cooperative relationships.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:52.740
That's what is interesting to me and in Latin America it isn't the Lille or the Nice France that we talk about.

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:58.840
We're talking about France in Latin America, that is to say Guiana.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.760
I think that you all saw that there's a problem in Guiana.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:11.540
Don't you think it would be better if Guyana became a part of the Latin America sphere on a cooperative mode. Don't you agree with that?

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:16.440
It's worth it, isn't it? Guiana is a territory of Latin America

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:24.360
and I see people mocking me when I say that the longest border in France is with Brazil, not with Germany.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:30.220
Why are they mocking me? Isn't Guiana France?

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:37.220
There's this dismissive, neocolionialist feeling among those who look down on Guiana

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:43.200
to the point where it doesn't come to their mind that the border at Guiana is interesting to us and get is involved directly,

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.500
because what is on the other side of this border? You just have to use your mind.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:53.740
Who's on the other side? Brazil, that is to say one of the world's emerging power. This isn't nothing.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:08:02.560
It is - how could I say that - an amazing partner for them, a little territory like Guiana.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:10.620
I'm not done. All the Caribbean countries there. Look a the map.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:17.520
In the Caribbean islands you have french territories: Martinique, Guadeloupe, Saint-Martin,

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:22.380
all of this counts and them, isn't it better for them to be in their surroundings?

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:30.200
Isn't it interesting for us, french people, to give to these territories the responsability to ensure that we're linked to the Americas?

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.200
Isn't it good for cooperation, trading, all of that?

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:38.240
So they should know better. Those who are always talking to us about globalisation, they're there, blabla...

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:41.320
They only want globalisation so that they can create single markets

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:47.280
and when we're actually speaking about the way we should organise cooperation with our surroundings...

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:54.760
Around our territories they're all gone. They're watching things with a spoon, making things up. So that's what the ALBA is.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:59.760
What countries are in the ALBA? I brought a note so I won't forget anyone.

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:05.900
It's important to know who's in the ALBA. "There's Venezuela!" Well yes, it's true, there's Venezuela.

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:09.400
Venezuela is the country with the world's largest oil stock.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:14.480
I personnaly want to put a stop to carbon energies, but you people, you the smart ones,

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:19.900
it doesn't matter to you to have a relationship with the country that has the world's largest oil stock?

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:24.320
No, they didn't even think about it? It doesn't interest them. They make their propaganda and that's it.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:35.380
So, what countries are members of the ALBA? There is: Venezuela, Bolivia, Nicaragua, Cuba,

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:39.440
Dominica, Saint-Vincent, the Grenadines,

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:48.080
Ecuador, Saint-Lucia, Antigua and Barduda, that are also an island.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:55.780
We're a Caribbean nation, so we're interested in working with people from the Caribs, in cooperation

00:09:55.780 --> 00:10:03.540
and not just to say, "we're interested in you because we want to dump tons of goods on your head so that you can't produce them by yourself."

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:09.260
And among the observers... So they're saying to us "Oh, but there are Russians and Iran, that's not really democratic."

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:16.460
There are no russians. It's like that. It's odd, isn't it? Intelligent, cultured journalists and everything...

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:21.140
Why do they feel the need to make things up? To scare you because they fundamentally

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:26.720
believe that you're imbeciles whose minds they can fill with anything, to whom they can tell anything,

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:30.900
and that it scares you. So, what countries are observers? Haiti.

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:34.800
Haiti is important to us, you know the misery in which Haiti dwells.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:40.960
It's not nothing for us to have a local cooperative relationship with Haiti,

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:46.520
because we can do a lot of things with Haiti and because we owe them a debt, my friends.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:50.480
You do know that we destroyed everything in Haiti, you do know that there was a war between us,

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:55.080
and that it's from there that the world's first black Republic was born,

00:10:55.080 --> 00:11:02.640
and that during decades we made Haiti pay for their slaves' buy-back.

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:09.180
So us french people we owe Haiti a debt and if tomorrow I become the President of the French Republic

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:15.120
I'll do anything in my power so that Haiti can breath back.

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:18.780
And what will Haitians ask us? What do you believe they'll ask us?

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:22.880
Machines so that they can produce energy, so that they can start to organize,

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:30.260
so that they can start to organise electricity to pump water or filter it to access potable water

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.820
and so if they get energy, stop cutting all the woods that are there

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:40.360
because as we cut all the woods, the ground goes down in the sea and so then there's no more arable land. Do you see how little is needed?

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:43.720
So it is important to us that we work with Haiti.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:47.840
There is also Syria and Iran that are observers, yes.

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:55.780
Well, they must be observers like in a lot of other meetings in which there are french observers,

00:11:55.780 --> 00:12:00.540
and we're not asking from the people that are coming in this to approve the regime of this one or this one,

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:05.040
because if you're asking me, I've never agreed with the Iranian regime

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:09.340
so I won't start now, I've never agreed with them.

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:14.760
Back in the days of the Ayatollah Khomeini, I didn't support his return to Iran

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:21.140
and there are also other countries; maybe you know Uruguay, it's the country of Pépé Mujica.

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:27.060
And then there's Paraguay. I don't agree at all with the government in Paraguay, why don't they talk about that?

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:31.140
It's a government that started on a coup, and they don't even talk about Paraguay

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:38.660
they're quoting Syria and Iran, but they don't talk about the others. You see that all of this intox, brainwashing.

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:43.760
So the ALBA is an organisation that is interesting to us, as french people,

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:47.160
and I think that it would be a good thing that we fit in this,

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:53.220
it would be a way to say "France is a Carribbean and a Latin American power"

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:57.140
All of this started... Nobody knew about the ALBA before that

00:12:57.140 --> 00:13:03.040
because on France Info this morning they asked Clémentine Autain about it, and they said she is my spoke person, which she's not.

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:07.260
Not because I don't want her to be but because she didn't wanted to be,

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:14.020
2 or 3 months ago when we asked her about it because she had other priorities,

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:20.400
such as her campaign for the general election, but we're friends and everything is alright,

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:28.600
I jump on the occasion to say that, but it's an idea of this TV station to make people up with the title of spoke-person, so then

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:33.180
after of course, it goes bad when the spoke person is being asked a question and we say "She looks embarrassed".

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:37.620
I'll tell you why she's embarrassed: because she don't know what it's about.

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:40.240
And it's normal, you can't know everything about everything,

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:43.480
especially when the others say to her "So, you agree with Mélenchon

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:47.800
who wants to make an alliance with the ALBA in which there's Russia and Iran?"

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:51.500
so of course she's embarrassed as she doesn't know the subject, and I don't blame her for that.

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:56.180
How can you know everything about all the subjects? Do you believe that I now all the subjects in my program

00:13:56.180 --> 00:14:00.460
and in the 40 booklets well then I'll tell you that no I don't, I read everything but

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:05.640
I'm not capable of answering every questions, especially when the one asking it he's doing it with the intent

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:10.740
to deceive you, to lead you to make a mistake, and that's what these two are doing.

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:13.300
If she asked me before, I would have told her: "beware,

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:21.280
those guys, they've already broadcasted three times on their channels the extract where I say that I want to give France back to the french

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:28.880
so with here, the fourth time... This is what became information in the public service

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:33.000
and after that they're surprised that I don't want to go there, but it's very simple I won't go

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:39.440
don't want to fall in their traps to be thrown in the face so-called questions that the french are asking themselves.

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:44.400
Stop kidding me, the french people are asking themselves if the ALBA is good or not?

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:48.040
Of course I'm okay to talk about it as it is in the program,

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:54.060
but not in such a fake way. It's a shame. That's what it is, it's a shame.

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:59.980
They must be really scared to use such shameful tactics, but fortunately enough they're not all this way.

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:04.540
There are honest people in this profession that are trying to do their work the best that they can

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:11.180
and then you have the stars that are payed really expensive amounts so you need them to be worth it.

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:16.480
They're not that to inform you and you know it pretty well, they're there to tell you what to think and that's not the same thing,

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:21.440
it's not the same job. Well, people, I'll talk a little bit about the campaign

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:25.920
because as you saw it experienced an acceleration on our side

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:29.540
and it will just grow larger in the following week.

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:31.920
There, since the last weekly review

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:43.920
we got a good 20h on France 2, the same day we came out with... I mean, it's the Insoumis' Discord

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:50.720
that did a marvellous thing, the game Fiscal Kombat that was successful very quickly,

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:57.760
there has been hundreds of thousands of different users and I think that the people are having fun, there is even some that said that it's addictive.

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:06.620
It's really well done and it's quite fun to handle and there are a lot of political things

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:12.160
and the global idea is: we shake people and it makes euros to achieve our project.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:17.080
So that was friday. Then saturday we were on the show "On N'est Pas Couchés"

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:23.480
and it did quite well in ratings and anyway I was pretty interested in it when I recorded it

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:29.260
and the next day there was Marseille. The great Marseille meeting.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:33.900
And after that, if we have to stop this, the monday we started our radio "Les Jours Heureux".

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:38.940
So as you see there were a lot of things and the same monday when we started "Les Jours Heureux",

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:46.980
we started the 7 trailers that go around the country and the popular neighbourhoods so as you see it is a rush of work

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:53.540
and also all sort of friends got together on the platform to do the Melenphone.

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:59.980
It is a technic consisting calling people to motivate them for the upcoming election

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:04.800
and it is very efficient as we already got in contact with more than 20 000 persons in the country.

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:09.480
I think that it will rise in intensity because, and this is also true here, you'll be interested in this,

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:12.820
you can go on the platform and you can give some of your time from time to time

00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:17.400
to, by yourself, call people, so I believe that they give you phone numbers

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:21.620
because we're aiming at certain places in the country? What places?

00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:24.460
Those where the abstention rates are the higher, because we think that it's there

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:29.220
that we should convince people to come and vote for us, this is what our campaign is going for.

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:34.860
To us, our goal isn't to take a handful of votes here and there, it isn't what it's about to us.

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:41.340
It's about a substantive popular movement  that carries a candidate and a program

00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:47.140
and then accomplishes the program, so you see that the method must be well-done at all times.

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:54.560
I personally believe that what we see... We understand why they all got so scared, the TV anchors from the system

00:17:54.560 --> 00:18:00.440
that are defending the establishment, it's because they see really well that they're about to take a massive wave,

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:05.680
so in the following days they'll make things up, to try and break this movement.

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:08.940
Well, so far it's started really poorly because it's really grotesque.

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:12.720
Yesterday I was at Lille where we did a meeting...

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:16.300
I don't know when was the last time they ever was such a powerful popular gathering

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:22.900
so it was gigantic and people there were extremely enthuastic and they were really really reacting to

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:28.860
a number of specific political matters. You could hear that.

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:32.420
There was a moment where I got scared because I heard an enormous sound, I didn't know what it was.

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:48.880
It turned out it was people stomping out. So it made a wave

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:53.800
and it was really, really impressive. It was a huge success

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.920
But it has a political meaning, and you've got to understand that,

00:18:56.920 --> 00:19:00.240
it isn't just an event in a presidential campaign. It already wouldn't be bad!

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:04.020
There are people that would like to make campaign moments like this one, but they can't!

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:08.460
But well, be it at Marseille or Lille, these are such gigantic crowds

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:12.580
that it means that there's something that has to do, not only with the campaign,

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:16.620
but with the political and intellectual state of mind of the country;

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:24.540
with his reject of the ancient regime of the Vth republic and his puppets, but well they don't wan't to understand that

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:26.920
I personnaly don't care the voters will make a decision

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:30.440
and you'll see that the voters will have understood that it is necessary to move on

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:35.200
and that we should do that in the quietest way possible, but also in the deepest way possible.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:41.960
I'll go to Toulouse this sunday. And well for all this region, be it at Toulouse

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:47.360
or at the meeting that I'll do next week, you know, with the hologram

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:50.300
that well be present in six different halls.

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:56.620
Well each and every time we set up a centralised system to get tickets for the cars.

00:19:56.620 --> 00:20:02.440
It means that everyone can go because if you do it early and there's a problem with money

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:09.880
generally the friends get together so that they can go and come.

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:17.460
I'll see you there and I'll also see you on my platform.

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:27.060
Do you know that we're close to getting the 400 000 supports to my campaign

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:31.720
and like the people who signed are often the more active ones...

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:37.240
Active, it means that someone does something by himself or in a group and by the way it's incredible.

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:44.000
The other day, I have a friend, so he did a support group, and they're two or three support groups that start getting along with each other.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.900
And he says to me: "I go out in the street, and there was two persons that were giving out flyers."

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:54.620
So he stops there: "But, what are you doing, from which group are you?" In a nice way

00:20:54.620 --> 00:21:02.600
and the others they say like that: "No, groups bore us, we're just two pals and we order the material directly from the platform."

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:05.760
Here you have two persons saying that they're bored by groups

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:08.240
but anyway, when you're two it's already a group,

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:12.460
so they decide all alone what they'll do for their campagin and as they wanted to do it

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:17.860
they choose the material that suits them the best, what they'll do, from time to time they'll put up a poster here and there, well,

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:22.360
it's quite good, and I think that it has been a characteristic of this campaign that the people get involved,

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:26.740
but everyone in their own way with the way they want to get involved,

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:30.420
it's not something that comes from the outside. But anyway, there are moments

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:33.180
where we need to act all together because if we don't then we waste energy.

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:37.700
I hope that you'll be many in La plaine des Filtres, Toulouse because that's our next meeting

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:44.660
and then the six halls where we'll do the meeting of the last part of the campaign.

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:54.120
A subject that isn't really present on the political stage and in the information world is water.

00:21:54.120 --> 00:22:03.500
I get back to it quite often because I think that the cycle of water is one of the great stakes for human societies since the beginning.

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:06.640
So we can still believe that because we have running water then it's not a problem anymore.

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:10.980
But it's still a problem because we need to do with water in tubes and what water?

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:17.020
So, even before we talk about water valve and individual access to water,

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:26.000
we need to ask ourselves about water itself, because the humonguous human presence on the surface of the earth

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:31.660
produces all sort of pollution, we already talked about pesticides and all that,

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:35.600
and there is also pollutions that are linked to the human presence itself,

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:40.020
that is to say to the fact that we're human beings, and human beings

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:48.320
well they spread everywhere fecal matter and urine and everything, and all that goes to the ground

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:54.800
because there is a lot of places where it's not picked up by anybody, and from here, it gets into water.

00:22:54.820 --> 00:23:04.520
And then the World Health Organization finds out that there are 2 billion people

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:08.960
that drink water infested by fecal matter.

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:16.380
2 billion, it's roughly the equivalent of the total population of the planet

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:24.760
in the 50's of the previous century, so that you can see how much it represent.

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:34.200
It's a huge number of people and every year 500 000 persons die

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:44.820
because of diarrhea, epidemics that spread because of the fact that we drink water that is polluted by fecal matter.

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:53.500
So it's a gigantic problem that would cost nothing to solve -  or almost nothing -

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:58.300
if the Monetary Fund, the World Bank, all the people that have money

00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:08.020
got interested in anything else than trading of goods and the debts of countries.

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:17.100
Something needs to be done here and I think that we, once we get to power, we'll have a water policy

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:28.840
but a water policy from its collection, its treatment, its delivery,

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:36.760
its re-treatment once it's been used and about the way to put all this at the service of the human ensemble

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:43.500
of agriculture, of human beings, of animals, well, of all of those that have to do with the cycle of water;

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:51.960
The cycle of water, it's the fundamental cycle of life itself. You're composed of 85% of water and it's just this was.

00:24:51.960 --> 00:25:00.440
Water is the fundamental matter of the living, so to solve a problem of this nature investments are needed

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:05.240
and those are good investments because they guarantee the good health of the people

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:10.980
in the same time as a water circulation that makes their life infinitely less painful

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:16.940
and that's also a lot of jobs, so we find in this business

00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:23.420
the needs, the necessities of cooperation, because we need to give to countries that needs

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:31.620
technics that allows them to collect, clean and redistribute water and we now how to do all of this, us french,

00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:36.240
be it by private companies or by the state.

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:42.180
It isn't up to me to go and quote the private companies that I have been in conflict with in France

00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:48.300
because their role isn't as bright as some might tell you, but here are some ideas for the future

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:52.080
and it pleases me to see that as we mentionned and as we explained in our programs

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:58.060
some Development NGOs - at least 5 of them -

00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:05.180
said that our program was the program best fit to these problems and questions that are being raised by the co-development

00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:10.500
term that was very popular ten years ago and a lot less now

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:15.380
because those who wrapped themselves in this word didn't do anything

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:19.980
or things that are deplorable since then. But I'll come back to it, I believe in co-development

00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:26.540
everytime a country goes better, the others around goes better, that's what I believe in.

00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:31.560
I don't believe that we can make profit off of the misery of others for very long.

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:34.780
You know, the big countries always become aware of this at one point.

00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:39.560
The other day I was seeing a declaration by mister Martin Schulz

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:46.760
who is the german social democrat candidate to the function of chancellor for the next election that will take place in september

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:53.420
and well Martin Schulz says something to his fellow countrymen that is in my book "Le Hareng de Bismarck"

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:58.380
that at the time made me the target of acerbic reviews, of germanophobia,

00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:01.800
well there, it's Martin Schulz that says it. He's the ex-president of the European Parliament.

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:07.620
He says "We can't continue to think that we will be fine by impoverishing all the others"

00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:12.940
because he's aware of the fact that they themselves are not doing that well at all

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:17.560
and that the impoverishment of the others always end up being their own impoverishment

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:22.200
as the others have less interest and less possibilities to trade with them.

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:27.800
I think that our world is at the eve of a massive realization and I believe that - how to say that -

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:32.520
the interest that my campaign has gained is one of the form of this realization.

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:36.760
As I said yesterday, what is important in all of this isn't me, it's those who trust me.

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:39.860
Why do they trust me is what the people should ask themselves.

00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:44.660
It isn't some mass psychology thing, it's about a realization

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:49.720
the people are aware that it can't continue the way it is. Here it is. See you next week.
