00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.720
Hello

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.340
I will be addressing this message from the train I am travelling in

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.800
because a special circumstance calls me to it.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:14.960
Today, is the International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.020
and, I wanna talk about it.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.880
When talking about homosexuality,

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.280
we are talking about somebody's sexual orientation.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.580
Sexuality is one of the fundamental dimensions

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.280
of a human being.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.660
So we have to make things clear about this,

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:33.960
we have to think about it.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:40.420
And, to not just simply abstain ourselves on purely moral reasons for fear of speaking poorly,

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.860
that's not the point.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.160
We have to understand what human beings are.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.020
Sexual orientation is not a choice,

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.820
it's not a habit we learn.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:54.800
It's an orientation

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.700
that makes you, by your very being, like one sex or the other,

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:08.400
and since it is not a choice, it makes us able to think about the absurdity it is

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.540
to blame people in this situation for it.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.480
That translates to extremely violent acts,

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.680
to words that hurt, humiliate!

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.060
it doesn't make any sense!

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.080
Practices of discrimination

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.600
and very often, tragedy,

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.180
because, for example, in a family they do not accept their child's homosexuality

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.720
and they kick them out.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.480
It's terrifying!

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:40.800
Of course, we have to take in consideration the people who are pained by this,

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.800
but we have to realise it's terrifying,

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.800
those who are being kicked out can't do anything about it,

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.860
it's not their choice!

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.020
And, at times there are acts of violence

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.400
from people that are uncomfortable

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.560
with themselves, not others,

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.540
who are being violent against gay people

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:05.060
as a way of expelling their own sexual ambiguity...

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.740
So...

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.400
Our fight against homophobia,

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:18.580
Is a fight which is not merely a feeling of fraternity and humanity,

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.920
it is also profoundly philosophical, which states that "All human beings are alike."

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:31.380
And their similarity to one another does not depend on what they do.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.660
Their similarities depend on who they are and what needs they have.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.020
It is very important to understand that.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.020
And, it is the same thing when it comes to transgender people.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.140
Transgenderism is often very moving,

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.220
firstly when it comes to understanding, most of us have to think deeply

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:00.680
to understand the journey, the logic that defines a transgender person.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.580
But, if we really think about it, and once we have made the effort of thinking about it,

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:06.540
and I'm asking that we all do,

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.760
well, we have to say that transgender people are a very good news for humanity

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.760
because it proves that

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.760
human similarities

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.240
go beyond gender

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.740
and thus there is indeed one human identity

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.640
transcending all human practices

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.940
and which unites us in our similarity.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.720
I think that

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.840
it's always best to look towards where progress can be made for all of us

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.600
because condemning things, and uttering non-sensical, hurtful, upsetting words

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.220
being violent,

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.580
none of this leads anywhere;

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.580
Everybody knows that when they think about it for five minutes.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.420
That's why I think that this day against homophobia

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.860
and against transphobia must allow us to better ourselves.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.860
Giving us time to think.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.900
Once the thinking is done,

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.560
our perception of reality changes,

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.440
and it becomes possible to improve.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.160
And, it is obviously the aim we should set,

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.820
while we try to think philosophically,

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.820
and here, in this case

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.060
politically,

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.760
since, as you know,

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.660
political forces are being built

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:28.620
by using homophobia and transphobia as fuel.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.200
It is absurd!

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.700
As absurd as racism is!

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.100
It has no objective basis.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.100
But you see how

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.060
bettering everyone's understanding  of the situation, however, has a political impact

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.600
I, for one, bet that once that

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
as soon as the law condemns,

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.440
let me remind you, slander

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.840
and, in particular, slander of homophobic or transphobic nature

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.080
which are punished by law.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.620
As soon as the law allows that,

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.860
those who wish it,

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.240
may get married,

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.720
same-sex couples included,

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.720
then there will be a good framework,

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.480
for, starting there, spirits will change.

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.900
This will not wash away what you may think of yourself,

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.580
but, undoubtedly, the way you look at others will be different.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.580
Therefore, it is a philosophical struggle

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.420
and a political struggle

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:30.320
against those who have homophobia and transphobia more or less unthoughtfully

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.380
which some people feel when confronted to something they do not understand,

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.380
and, as you know,

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.380
the lack of understanding

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:42.940
most often leads straight to oversimplicistic explanations.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.040
There. That's what I wanted to tell you.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.480
During the presidential campaign,

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.480
maybe you remember it,

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.800
but I took some time during our meeting in Lille

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.780
to stop and speak about one event

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.780
which we'd just learned about, in Chechnya.

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.480
The persecution of homosexuals.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.800
And I thought it important to mention

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.800
to the people who were there, and you see

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.580
the room, which was filled to the brink with people,

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:16.480
I don't remember how many were there, eight or fourteen thousands, no matter, we were many,

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.480
well, I felt that there was good will, because

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.700
in great numbers, people applauded my condemnation

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.500
of homophobia.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.860
"And of course we have a special thought,

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.460
since we just this information was just confirmed

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.940
for the homosexual people, in Chechnya

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:45.460
who are the target of arrests and violences of all kind."

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:53.480
Above all, when I read to the people gathered, the heinous speech of this chechnyan official,

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:57.700
who said that, "In any case, there is no persecution

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.700
because there were no gays in Chechnya"

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:00.860
[exasperation]

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.860
Obviously, in Chechnya, like everywhere in the world,

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.640
like in every society...

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.640
But this speech was a total brutality,

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:10.560
because it was denying the very reality of these factual events.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.300
Thus, it amounts to the worst,

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.260
that is, calling people with different sexual orientations

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.720
sick, insane or vicious or who knows what else.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.600
"To object to those accusations,

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:31.840
Mr. Alvi Karimov, spokesman of the Chechnyan leader Ramzan Kadirov,

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:41.820
stated to the news agency, when he was asked 'What happened? You are arresting and imprisoning people! For the fact that they are homosexual!

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.200
Why good would that do?

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.740
He said:

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:50.580
"You can't arrest and detain people who don't exist in this republic.

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:54.800
Homosexuality does not exist here."

00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:00.160
You see, [booing] when such things are said, the situation is really bad.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:04.360
And then, he added something extremely cruel,

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:08.400
and that's why I want to say something about it tonight,

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:14.520
he added: "if such people existed in Chechnya," - and of course they do exist -

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:19.700
"the law wouldn't have to deal with them," he said

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:24.540
"since it's their own parents who would have already sent them where they would never be back.""

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:26.140
Well, today,

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:32.940
I'm stating again that I shall participate in the fight against homophobia and transphobia.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:36.820
I understood all of this for a very long time.

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:38.580
Frankly, it as not my topic of choice,

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.920
but in 1988, I was sent to a meeting

00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:46.720
organised by an association called "Gays For Freedom"

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.720
and they were the ones who

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.460
first made me aware of the reality of what was happening,

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:54.600
when a homosexual couple had...

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.600
at the time, it was when AIDS killed many, during those tragic years,

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.640
the heartbreak when their loved one died,

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.020
the evictions, the family that turned them down,

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:04.840
all of that cruelty, sometimes unintended, all of it

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:07.320
befalling on homosexual people.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.240
And thus, I was honored to be the first to

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.060
think of proposing legislation

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:15.700
concerning gay marriage.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.620
My law was named "Law For Civil Partnership"

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.180
and it was dropped on the Senate's desk,

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:24.800
it was the first time it happened,

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:26.900
in the parliamentary assembly, in France,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.440
in 1991

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.280
There. I think that

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:33.580
during this day of struggles,

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:39.120
we should always think on how to personally participate and contribute,

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:43.660
And, I think, all of you who are listening to me, first because you are indeed listening to me, [laugh]

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.060
are thinking, maybe,

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.480
but also, go for it!

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:50.520
Go to people who have false impressions on the matter,

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:53.600
who think wrongly, in a bigoted way.

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:55.740
Talk to them! It's worth it because

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:58.040
when you tell them: "You know, it is not a choice."

00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:59.740
I swear, it changes everything.

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:01.420
They start questioning.

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.680
And they introspect,

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.340
There's something good, deep down all of us,

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:09.960
Let's not believe... let's not believe there's only wickedness. It's not true.

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:14.220
There's always something good. If we bet on that, we can trigger the right thing and BAM!

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:17.300
We get results [thumbs up!] That's it. See you soon!
