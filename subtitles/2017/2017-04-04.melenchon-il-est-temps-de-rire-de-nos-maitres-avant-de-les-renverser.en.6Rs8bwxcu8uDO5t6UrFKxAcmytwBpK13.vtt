00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:07.890
« The masters - it's a quotation - the masters that you can see, are convinced to be right,

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.920
behaving the way they do.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.760
Such is the absurdity which reflects their structure.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:26.160
They even feel justified in accepting evil in order to result in good consequences.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.720
One of the most satisfying of their phony axioms is that they claim to be superior

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.640
to everyone else in terms of wisdom and efficiency.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.500
- Isn't that true ? They call me a fool and they say that they will make society works.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.720
As a result, I am wise and insanity is their thing.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:55.460
With this sanction, they claim the right to allocate bread and butter for all the human race.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:02.560
They have even resurrected the theory of kings' divine right, kings of trade in this case.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:11.600
The weak spot of their claim is that they're only businessmen.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.520
They aren't philosophers : they are neither biologists nor sociologists.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.000
If they were, everything would hopefully be better.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.820
But outside of the business world, those people are stupid.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.720
They can only understand business.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.100
They can neither understand the human race nor the world, but they present themselves as

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:43.020
arbiters of the fate of millions of starved, and of all multitudes of people.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:51.060
History, one day, will burst out laughing at them the hard way.»

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:58.240
Time has come to make fun of our masters before overthrowing them !
