00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.980
Presenter: Let's suppose that you are elected.

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.020
What will be your first ten measures?
And I mean concrete measures.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:16.620
JLM: First of all, I will convene a constituent assembly on my first day in office.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.360
It means that the French people will be called to rebuild itself politically

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.900
by defining the new organizational rules of the country's political life.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.400
We'll get rid of the presidential monarchy—at least I hope so—

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:40.660
and we'll enter a new era of civic power and civic revolutions in which citizens can have control over their representatives.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.960
I mentioned the recall election as an example earlier,
but there are many other possibilities.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.120
But first of all, the funding act is the rewriting of the rules of political life..

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.680
Once the new Constitution is voted and applies,
I'll leave office.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.040
Presenter: So you won't stay in office?

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.300
JLM: No I won't, since there will be a new Constitution.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.480
I won't be the guy who says "I was elected for 5 years so I will stay until the end".

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.680
Maybe I'll have a role in the new Constitution, but before that I'll leave office.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.500
The first reason why people should vote for me is that I'll give democracy a good sweep.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.940
and that we'll create a new set of rules in which some things will be allowed and others forbidden.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.860
This is the first measure. The second  measure is a global programme but I'll summarize it as "sharing the wealth".

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.520
This situation in which some have everything and a growing number of people have nothing has to stop.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.440
There are around 9 million poor people in this country, and 13 million in Germany.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.860
It is a huge category of the population.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.520
A poor is not only the person you see on the street—and it is already tragic!

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.360
It is also the co-owner—lots of people are falling into poverty!

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:59.860
So we'll share the wealth, and then we'll give priority to investments in ecological planning.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:08.260
To me, ecology is the most important issue of our time,
and we are fussing about things that are not worth it.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.840
The human civilization is facing destruction because of the way we consume and produce.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:21.000
I wish the Green Rule to be written in the Constitution: we can't take more from the Earth than can be renewed.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:27.000
At least, we the French people will do it, because we have the chance to have the intellectual, material and financial means to do so.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.040
Presenter: Next decision.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.980
JLM: Now, I'll move on to a more controversial topic.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.300
I do not accept the current trend of the European policy.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.920
It will kill our country after it has destroyed it.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.400
Moreover, it will destroy the European ideal because people will end up hating it.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.160
This is unbelievable, we've been fighting for this ideal for a century and a half!

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.180
As a consequence, we must exit the European treaties.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.260
JLM: So... Where were we?
Presenter: Let's say this was decision n°5.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.280
JLM: OK... so decision n°6 is about peace.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.420
Until now, peace has been taken for granted.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:09.820
There were minor wars sometimes, in which "savages" killed one another, and we looked this from afar with contempt,

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.060
but now we see that the threat of a generalized war is real.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.100
Acting for peace is therefore an emergency.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.260
One way to act for peace is to reinforce the role of the UNO,

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.480
but we also have to leave NATO, the military alliance of which France is a member,

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.960
because NATO is a war machine at the service of North-Americans that leads us nowhere.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.180
And, more particularly, I'm afraid it leads us to war in Europe.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.360
Therefore, we must build another alliance.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.900
In a nutshell, I became a French independentist,

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:54.640
and I am in favor of an alter-globalist alliance with other countries. We can do it, we have partners for that.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:01.260
I advocate the idea of implementing solidarity-based protectionism as a rule,

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.860
I do not believe in free-market economy. I think that it leads to everyone's downfall and to ecological catastrophe.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.860
On the contrary, I believe in solidarity-based protectionism.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:15.560
Protectionism means that we'll relocate as many productions as possible—starting with agricultural productions

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:24.700
that we'll try to diversify as much as possible over the territory—and that we'll put barriers, like normative barriers.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.000
For example, I do not agree with the fact that a commodity that is produced by slave kids

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:35.460
costs as much as a commodity made by workers who have a social protection.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:41.120
Or environmental norms. A product that has traveled thousands of kilometers,

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:46.560
like a shrimp that was fished somewhere, and then shelled somewhere else, and then packed up in another place.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.160
No, I don't agree with this, these products must be taxed. Can solidarity-base protectionism work ?

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.320
You people from the cinema industry know it works.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.140
There is the TSA tax: everytime you go to a movie, this tax funds the next movie.

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.420
Some say: "This is a system that allows you French people to make movies", well yes it is!

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:06.620
Presenter: The famous "cultural exception"!

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.980
And the result is that we watch movies more than anywhere else

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.560
because this tax funds theaters and improves technical skills.

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.240
Virginie Efira: And various genres, not always in defined commercial circuits.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.320
JLM: Absolutely! It benefits the whole sector.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.300
So we see that this form of protectionism works. Now, if you want a last measure...

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.180
Presenter: The last one.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:33.180
A very concrete measure: we have to phase out nuclear power and this will take time.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.000
It takes a long time and we have already lost a lot of time.

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:43.100
We can't phase out nuclear power in a snap, so we have to set an objective of 100% renewable energy.

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.020
Do we know how to do this? Yes.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:49.340
I know that if I was president, we'd have to demonstrate that it is possible, and we'd have to do it quickly,

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:54.060
because nowadays, deadlines are short and public attention quickly wanes.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.420
So within the first two years,

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.940
we'll have to develop an alternative energy production to compensate the equivalent of

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.180
2, 3, 4 or 5 nuclear reactors.

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:10.340
I think we can do this using off-shore wind turbines and other means like geothermal energy and many others.

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.560
I'll just mention one last measure.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.780
We have to stop consuming animal proteins.

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:23.360
I am talking about the animal suffering, and about the abominable crimes that we are committing

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.360
not only against animals but also against the Earth.

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.900
We have to do this quickly!
You must understand that this is an emergency!

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.820
And for this we'll need some will,

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.940
we must be able to say "no" to a world order, to propose a new one and to set an example,

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:40.720
and you will see that dozens of countries will be interested in what we are,

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.140
We could share with them the good technique and ways to do things.

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:48.660
We could share all this with them so that they do what we want to do as well as us.
