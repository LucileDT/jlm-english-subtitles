00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.040
JLM: You must be the revolutionaries that will transform life! And thoroughly change the society.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.820
So this is the event right here. It costs 3 euros ... Not too bad!

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.360
So those who are watching me, they can go to the local bookstore and buy it for 3 euros.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.620
We will all be in the streets, there'll be about 1,000 outlets... roughly speaking!

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.260
We hope -and we'll be ready for the 10th December: 1000 outlets.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:59.060
JLM: Hello... Hello... how are you? You managed to keep some? They are sold out everywhere!

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.140
Woman holding the stand: We sold lots of them earlier... Before you arrived...

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.940
JLM: Why don't I have a beautiful badge like this eh? It is nice, isn't it?

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.000
Man: We're selling them if you want one!

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:33.100
JLM: The 170,000 involved in my campaign, show their support in a miriad of ways... You know I couldn't open 1000 campaign outlets if they were not there!

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:52.760
JLM:You're 16 years old, you know we propose the vote at 16. Take the program, read it, discuss it, and come see me on the Internet ok?

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.100
Man: Yeah I saw on Youtube your channel and stuff, I watched some videos.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.580
JLM: In The Common Future, which is my program, being presented at the moment,

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.120
there is a vision for the world. This is not a bunch of measures, it is truly a vision for the world.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.000
Woman: And you are the only one who shares my values. Thank you !

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.840
JLM: Thank you, Madam! I'm going to be emotional now!

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.080
Woman: No, thank you for being here! Really!

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:23.060
Man: I've never voted in my life, but at 63 years old, yesterday, I registered to vote. I followed your advice:
"register, and we oust them!"

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.940
There you go! And it will be for you!
The first time in my life!

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.120
Someone: Next president, eh!

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.000
JLM: Of course! You have to vote ok?

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.560
Someone: We will!
